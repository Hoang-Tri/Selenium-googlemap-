place: B·∫øn Ninh Ki·ªÅu
    review:
        Hong Nguyen: Coming to the Mekong Delta without stopping at Ninh Kieu wharf would probably be a mistake.
                The feeling of sailing on the vast river really makes us satisfied.  Beautiful scenery, delicious food, and many convenient services available at reasonable prices.  Come here and feel it your way.
                Highly recommended!
        Arun Jayaprakash: Visited the marina to take a boat on our way to the Cai Rang Floating Market. The place is neat and well maintained, with beautiful gardens, plants and trees, and is a nice place to spend time with a view of the river.
        H√† Vi·ªát Th·∫Øng: It‚Äôs new year so there are so much lights. Very cool, very demure
        Ko Koo: The floating market tour was okay... not really impressive.
                If you don't have time in C·∫ßn Th∆°, you can easily pass on this tour. Typical tourist trap.

                The fruit sellers will come to you and try to sell it. If you don't like this kind of vibe, it's not for you....

                If you have time to kill and wouldn't mind to go around the river for 2 hours, go for it.
        Tomas Hendrych: Be sure what you expect. There is almost no floating market any more, there are tourist floating souvenir market. We paid for private boat, had to wait 30 minutes abd finaly ended with 10 other tourist.
        Natalia T: We rented a small boat for two people at 400,000 VND, which I found to be a reasonable price. Larger boats cost 100,000 VND per person and carry up to 20 people, but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre worth it. To get a good deal, arrive at the port by 4:50 AM. The trip to Cai Rang floating market takes about 50 minutes by boat. Well, if you come to Can Tho you should definitely try it but please do not overpay for it.

                Cai Rang, however, feels overhyped. It‚Äôs not the bustling market with hundreds of small boats as often depicted. Instead, it‚Äôs mostly tourist barges with just a few local boats, and there‚Äôs little genuine commerce happening. You‚Äôll find one boat selling coffee, another offering noodles, and a couple of floating restaurants. We stopped at a staged rice paper factory and at the shops aimed at selling souvenirs. Unfortunately, the water is also heavily polluted with garbage, which takes away from the experience.
        David Henderson: A nice area to walk through, but kind of a bummer being constantly accosted by people trying to sell you boat tickets.

                FYI don't buy from any of them.

                Visited during my 2024 bicycle trip around SE Asia. Watch on YouTube: @VeloObscura
        J C: The highlight of this warfare was supposed to be the boat dining experience. Sadly, the ride was short of good, and the food was mediocre at best.

                Boat ride: With the expectation of a moving boat accompanying sights and views of the river, you only get about 5 minutes of the boat going. Then the boat makes a slow rotation and your headed back to base.

                Music on the boat was ok. Was not the best as it only included traditional music.

                Food: Orders of food was pricey. Even the sodas were pricey. The best deal you would get is ordering one of the hotpot. Anything else, don't say you weren't warned. But, to be fare, it's a tourist attraction. So pricey food is expected.

                Overall, this boat dinner affair isn't good. Many things can be improved. Many things can be possible, should the owners want it better to represent Vietnam.
        C CLARENCE: Fun place to visit lot's of nice restaurant's and Bar's around. The floating market isn't much existing as I expected. Looks like it doesn't active as it used to be. But anyway you can experience what it's looks like Vietnamese culture
        Nguyen Thanh Tam: Touristic site with lots of restaurants, buildings and shops, so not spacious enough for those who like walking.
                This is also a boat dock to visit the floating markets and the island so many vendors will come to offer the services as you walk by but they are polite, not try to stop or scare you. Totally understand why they have to do this, COVID time and very few guests.
        Eric Christophe: Great place with garden, as a ship docking there local authorities are not very complaisant or helpful, for our guests to embark the Sampan. Can tho is a busy town with its floating market CAI RANG therefore it can be very noisy for the guests sleeping and karaoke going on late at night.
        Dr. Stephen Bui: Really nice place to walk by the pier with lots of restaurants and coffee shops. The place is beautiful and made to accommodate pedestrians. Lots of restaurants on the river as well. You would have a wonderful time there for dinner and after.
        Darren Bird: I truly love this place. Day or night it is spectacular. A wonderful open place for walking. All sorts of food for sale. And a bridge for lovers. Young or old you will be enamored by this place. 5 stars.
        Thu L∆∞u: I went on Saturday, the led lights are turned off, so, I can not see many things in there.
                I came in October during flood season, so the streets are drowned.
                I came back Nink Kieu wharf at the next morning, I can photo some pictures there.
                That's an experience bad.
        Olivine Thuy Phan: So nice, the atmosphere so nice in the morning, location veru friendly
        Jeff Byron: Quick little ferry to get across the river. Costs  4000 per person for a return trip.
        Tu Nguyen: Pure Air with view, you can see Can Tho River, Hau River. You also can see Can Tho Bridge. Clean and many people visit there in the evening. But sometimes Some people ask you want to go Cai Rang Floating Market by their boats, I thought that it is too dangerous although I want to help them because they are poor. This is a good place for having a walk.
        Ho√†ng Y·∫øn Ph√πng: "Ninh Kieu Wharf" is one of the most famous symbols of Can Tho City and is also a cultural symbol of the Southwest region. The  floated market usually begins at dawn, which is very bustling and crowded. They mainly sell fruits for the traders as well as many products like a normal market. It has attracted many domectic and foreign tourists come to enjoy the feeling of traveling on the river. There are some ships for rent to take you around the river to take part in the lively atmosphere of Ninh Kieu Wharf. üíú
        Dan Nguyen: The city improved this place quite a bit.  I love how you take a long walk along the river.  It is dimly lit in some area,  but brighly lit in the tourist area.  There are several boats serving dinner cruise at night.  You can order food,  and they add $.50 or 10,000 dong for the cruise.  I don't like the loud music and the crowd.  I come before the cruise and eat on the boat, and get off the boat before the cruise.  You can hire a boat to take you on the opposite side of the river, to enjoy the extremly long promenade,  a good place to practice a marathon or ride your bike.
        To Nhu Tran: Welcome to Can Tho (my hometown) ü•∞
                        Proud of was born and grown up at here!
                        Wish you have a great vacation/business trip! ‚Ä¶
        Eric D∆∞∆°ng: Nice and cool place at night. Maybe not so clean. There are many small boats on the quay. Rental price is just 10usd per hour sailing around the Mekong river in Can Tho
        Loc Van Truong: Night walking street with variety foods and drink. Resonable price. With night market at the end, variable clothing and toy choices for adults and kids.
        Anh Chau: Very clean area and fresh air. Good for morning jogging
        –ú–∞–∫—Å–∏–º –ò–≤–æ–Ω–∏–Ω: A beautiful park with a promenade along the Mekong River, there are very few tourists, not far from the park in 5 minutes walk there is a large local market with cheap prices
        HAZIZIE SIDEK: Beautiful View. Clean and nice walkway. Such a relaxing and good memories take photo with friends and family.
        Huongt Minh: Very famous place in Mekong Delta is B·∫øn Ninh Ki·ªÅu, located in the center of Can Tho city, Ninh Kieu district, very easy for you to find this place. You'll see Ben Ninh Kieu very dynamic in the evening, there are many food and souvenirs kiosks. Many diversified food for you to try. Beside that, you can also have many beautiful photos in the Ninh Kieu walked bridge.
        V≈© Th·ªã Kim Chi: Not bad. They have night market here
                And in the morning, from the left side. I can take a walk and discover some foood vegetables in the market
        Bill Lovett: I and my wife visited in an early Saturday evening. Lots of people about. Nice vibe, great futuristic  lights. Just lovely.
        Ben Quintana: Open bridge across the water. Relaxing walk and nice views plus it is free to just hangout. A few restaurants around so it is a good spot to stop before or after eating.
        Lan Anh Nguy·ªÖn: This is a place for relaxation at the weekend. You can bring your children, go skating, take a walk around the Ninh Ki·ªÅu harbor. There are cruises for tourists. You can book tickets first. You can go sightseeing on the cruise and enjoy the nightlife. Along the river, there are a bunch of coffee shop where you have a cup of black coffee or cold beer. If you're hungry you can wander around and find many street food venders at the food market.
        Volkan Sakarya: Try to use known agencies on Marina Road. Some scammed people can approach you to sell Mekong boat tour and show their boat. Please don't take into consideration their offer even cheaper than official tour agencies.
        Let√≠cia Usanovich: Great evening vibe by the river. Also great street food market in the area. You can book tours to the floating market at the pier.
        Richard jackson: Nice restaurant, has a better than average drinks list, nice service and views of the boats chuggingup an down the river. Friendly staff. 100k vnd for a glass of Dalat white wine.
        Mr. RA THA: Nice hotel and nice pace to visit it. It is located in Can Tho city, Mekong Delta. This is a new city in the Mekong and attracting many tourists come stay at the hotel and visit it. Close to the hotel is a Walking Bridge
        Dazai Au: The park is green and clean, it is great to have a walk here in the morning and watch boats.
        Can Pham: Coming to Can Tho city, this beautiful place is great to see in the evening.
        VAN DEO NGUYEN: the beautiful park beside the river, most of visitor are walking along side of park and walking bridge (Can Tho's Love Bridge). But if you wanna see the whole park with light and reflection, you can take a boat to Fishing Village to see the park from other side of river
        Nguyen Duc Nguyen: Clean water and fresh air morning and night. Just wonderful!
        vu nghi nguyen: Beautiful place to visit...be mindful when crossing the road.
        Robert Chase: Beautiful at night. Great views. Great place to bring the family at night.
        Son Nguyen Van Thanh: Beautiful park, too crowded at the weekend.
        Ryan Shady: Nice and happening place. You can get from street food to gourmet just by walking along the street. You can also get souvenirs or clothing at the night market, but remember to bargain. This is what Ben Thanh market and Bach Dang wharf of Sai Gon used to look and fell like 10-15 years ago
        Anh Nhi Ta: Having a cup of hot tea and enjoying night scene from the high is recommended [at the hotel - but cannot remember the name, but it is opposite to the floating restaurant area). The price is not as expensive as I expected (~1.5-2USD/ cup of tea/ coffee).
        Linh Clark: Crowded and not much to see.
        Trung Nguyen: It was a nice experience. The food were good but very expressive.
        Miroslav Lazic (Miki): Central spot of Can Tho city. Nice walking area, well illuminated and clean.
        Jack lee S·ª©c s·ªëng m·ªõi: A fun place to hang out with many activities, upstairs has billiards and archery and a very nice atmosphere, lots of choice for food and drinks! :))
        Michael Golden: We had a good lunch here while touring the water ways of this area. We also visited the area by day and night. It is a good place to step of to the night market or just walk around.
        Brian Collyer: Thoroughly recommend a long evening walk here. Great atmosphere, safe and convenient
        ◊ò◊ú ◊ú◊ï◊®◊ô◊ê: Colorfuly lit , gentle brease . A Verity of people walking talking and enjoying the weather. We sat to eat near by to enjoy the color show of sunset
        denise brooks: Interesting place to soak in Vietnamese local tourism on the water.
        Benny T W Wong: Peaceful and clean park with lots of park benches. Good river view to watch boats go by.
        francis dureza sablon: Can Tho City's South of Vietnam must visit place
        Rob Deleurme: It's the main tourist area of cantho, boat rides and plenty of shopping and during the holiday time a beautiful collection of of flowers and culture type displays and activities.
        Tr·∫ßn: Cool atmosphere, except for the rat, it tries to eat my bottom, but everything else is fine.
        Ho Ngoc Tin: So colorful at night. Crowded. Nice place!
        James O Mahony: Nice litre oasis with an impressive statue of Ho Chi Minh. A nicely tended garden and a pedestrian bridge
        Thanh Cao: Well come to Vietnam my lovely home town guys
        tchongi nguyen: A walking alley for night sightseeing in C·∫ßn Th∆°, nothing unforgettable unfortunately
        Khairul Hazrin Hashim: Nice scenary at dawn and dusk.. nice place to chill out
        l√™ ƒë√¨nh thi·ªán: Ok
        Vuong Nguyen An: A place to visit at night. Amazing!
        Joseph Sullivan: Expect to spend about 3 hours in the floating market, and we arrived around 5 am. The smaller boats will approach you mostly with fresh fruits. Sometimes they will have hot coffee, tea, or bun boa. Always break one open to verify the meat was cooked through.

                There‚Äôs some larger boats that you can board with mini markets. Other larger boats will line the shores and may have restrooms and a small dining area.

                For the best experience, doc at one of the tourist ports for hot food and restrooms. The floating market is a great experience.
        Erica Bailey: Great gardens well maintained.
                Lots of shade as we walked up to Lovers Bridge.
                Well worth a visit on the vast river in Can Tho.
        J DN: An enjoyable walk by the river.

                Higmmend early morning and late and night.
        Lian Chengyuan: Decent walk to experience how the locals chill. (the locals really love to karaoke, ha). The street food is interesting, esp if you take your time to look first.

                Went later at night, so unable to take those boat rides. On second time, maybe it's a blessing in disguise. Not that they are bad, just that, they look and feel like just another boat ride.
        Kenny G: One of the most fantastic 2-3 km walks in all of Vietnam. Whether at dawn or dusk, it never gets old and there's a lot of nice sights along the path. Do come at night when everything is lit up beautifully. Great town and this is one of the highlights.
        Ai Fu CHIN: Visit day and evening for different scenery.
        Kevin H. Nguyen: Great place and love the night market...
        Douglas Page: Interesting to see how daily life is for locals..
        Sujita Balami: Very good place to go and hang out with friends. Or couples can also enjoy in this peaceful place.
        M. HBart: Nice wharf but COVID-19 remnants are visible. We visited toward the end of raining season, hence there were not many foreign tourists. Businesses are trying to open back up slowly while others are still closed or went out of business.
                Visitors can take boat tours to the floating market to watch local traders go about their business daily or to visit local fish üêü farm.
        Qu·ª≥nh Mai L√™ Th·ªã: Ok
        Jeff Teh: Good to hangout at night in Can Tho
        Aaron d: Lovely park . Enjoy a pleasant walk along the river and a great newish bridge festooned with lights. Very.popular with Vietnamese locals and tourists taking a stroll or relaxing on the many benches. Great for taking selfies and holiday photos.
        Trung Nguyen Viet: Nothing special abt this place. There is long park along the wharf, make it nice to walk. There's a restaurant & coffee boat docking at the Wharf where u can enjoy some food & drink by the river.
        Bach Nguyen: Peaceful and beautiful. Should come here
        Th√†nh Ph·∫°m: Great!
        Shark Hunter: A good place to visit to see the floating markets. My advice is go with a local and hire your own boat. Its a great place to see real Can Tho life. The ladies who sell their food are generally happy to see foreigners and will smile if you are friendly.
        Khang Thanh D∆∞∆°ng: Such a nice place to walk and enjoy peaceful landscape of Can Tho province.
        fc looi: Room seems to be recently refurbished but the toilet is a let down. Poor water pressure and the shower is broken. Ask about the room if it's close to their karaoke. The room I had was close  and the karaoke was blasting away during the day. Luckily it was quiet the night I was there. It's close to a shopping centre and waterfront.
        Andrew Dinh: It's a fun place to walk around and chow down on snack food.  There is a little night market inside that you can browse around.   There were a couple floating restaurants that I could see.  There are souvenir shops inside.   It costs 40,000 Dong a car to park in their parking area.
        Harry Nguyen: Prime spot for tourists and local to hang out. Lots of restaurants, cafes, food stalls, and shops. You can take a dinner/Vietnamese music show boat tour to see the town from the river, or you can take a mini sampan boat tour from one of the piers from the local people. They usually charge 50k VND/person/hour. The sampan can accommodate up to 6 guests, but to be comfortable, 4 is max.
        Ngoc Quang Dang: Joyous promenade in Mekong delta
        Marcel Cybon: It is not relaxing for a stroll as you are bothered constantly by very pushy touts. Not worth to come to stroll around. Other areas of town with less tourists and touts are much better.
        Jean Pierre Jacobs: Visiting the market on the Mekong Delta river.
        Ngocminh Doan: Beautiful scenery. They ban vehicle traffic every Saturday night and holds event there, highly recommend visiting on Saturday nights.
        Henrik Snellman: Pretty nice riverside park
        vinh tran: Nothing special.
        Lars: Not much to see. Mainly an promenade by the riverside
        Hang Nguyen: I think Ninh Kieu Pier is a long-lasting and attractive tourist site in Can Tho with poetic landscapes and favorable position near Hau River. This is a attractive symbol of Can Tho that I really love to come every time I visit this city. It has beautiful views with comfortable atmosphere and the wind from Hau river. The decoration is nice. If you finish the road along Hau river side you will pass by Victoria Hotel. It is a long walking but worth to do.
        MinhBao Bui: Can i help u. If u don't want to be out of money
        Jacopo: This riverside walk is barely pleasent. Vietnam clearly loves these trash led lights and place them everywhere making me feel quite unconfortable. The bridge at the end of the shack is the major example.
        Tue Nguyen Phuoc: Great for a walk and enjoy life of the locals around. Get even further down to a market for tourist to discover more local specialities.
                Beware of guys who try to pursuade you to buy erotic massage services. It is illegal. Only go ahead if you are with a local who knows all tricks around.
        Sophie Hunt: As a tourist interest spot, I'd recommend finding your way to the statue. It's a large statue of ho chi Minh and the area is well kept, very nice walk along the quay.
        Vira Glushchenko: Good place for evening walk
        DiemThuy Huynh: Food not nice and the price quite expensive.
        Kh√°nh Thi ƒê·∫∑ng: Colorful place. Worth to take a trip.
        Tran May: So noisy n crowded on weeken. So great view at Ninh Kieu river. Night market around there. You can loooking everything you want.

        Viet Nam Tube: So beautiful at night.
        Louis Pham: Good place for walking
        Jane Fahlman: A nice little park to find some shade and a cool breeze. As with many vietnamese parks, wifi is free and readily available.
        Diana U: Love it. Love it. Beautiful place to rest and relax and enjoy the scene. But not at the weekend. Too many people there. It was too crowded. Go there weekdays to hangout.
        Gavin Brown: Nice tourist attraction.
                Well frequented by the locals as well.
                Best to go at night to see all the pretty lights
        C S: Very busy vietnamese market street. The food is amazing. If you are in C·∫ßn Th∆° you should definitely go there in the evening.
        Riki Hiagari: Love it

        Hyungnyoon Yoo: B·∫øn Ninh Ki·ªÅu ( Ninh Kieu Pier / Wharf )  ;

                Ninh Kieu Pier is situated on the right bank of Hau River, between the junction of Hau River and Can Tho River. This pier is adjacent to Hai Ba Trung Street, Tan An Ward in Ninh Kieu District of Can Tho City.
        Tris R (BrokeBritinParis): Nice Park by the side of the river, surrounded by local businesses. You may get touted for a boat tour but they take no for an answer.
        Duong Rinoa: Long time i didn't go to this place and It's quite crowded now! Lovers, friends moreover, I saw a lot of people catching pokemon go

        Tien Thach: Good
        Gia-Hue On: There  is a lack of light at night.
        Hu·ª≥nh Anh Nguy·ªÖn (Jenny): Good place for amazing views
        Benno Krummenacher: It could be so beautiful if the whole river wasn't full of trash.
Unfortunately, I have to point out this problem once again: the waste is simply left lying around somewhere. You can see the result in my photos, which I actually hate taking.
        74G1 √öts: The impression here is that there are quite a lot of Chinese people. There is a quite busy market, I didn't ask the price so I don't know what the prices of the items here are.
In the evening, there is a walking street with many houses built a long time ago, creating an ancient feeling. It's like getting lost in buildings like in a Hong Kong movie.

Nowadays, the wharf is mainly used for tourism purposes, but there is rarely any commercial space like before. I heard people here say that in the past, when there was no urbanization, it was much more fun.

This is a place that when you come to Can Tho, I think you should definitely visit to experience and feel.

        Luong Tri: A short business trip to Can Tho, although the time was short, I still tried to experience all the suggested places.
1. Night market - Ninh Kieu wharf: maybe because it's far from SG and it's in the middle of the week, not during the tourist season, so I feel deserted and peaceful => like this feeling.
2. While walking at the night market, I met a friend who advised me on floating market tickets from the Tu An shipyard => Completely by accident but highly appreciated:
- Dedicated consulting
- enthusiasm
- The ticket price is 100k but the train costs less than 20 but only has 4 tour guides. The two people in the photo are Huy - Hien (the other photo is me and my friend)
- Buying some fruits at the floating market is called experiencing the river.
- Everyone, please note that you should leave early around 5:00 am. They told me to leave before 5:30 am, but when I came out at 5:20 am, they expected only us to go (we came out early üò≥)

        Ngoc Dung Duong: Cool, fun. Ideal check-in point for young people
        Thy H∆∞∆°ng Ph·∫°m V≈©: Can Tho Market Complex - Can Tho Night Market - Ninh Kieu Wharf

Park the car at the coopmart and walk to the night market. The evening is cool, the lights are quite beautiful. Visit the night market to buy sticky rice with chicken and young eggs like a tiktok review. If there are many cars, stop by. On the opposite side of the street, there are advertising vehicles crowded with buyers. The price of sticky rice seems to be 45-55k/big box for 2 people, 5k/ball of foxglove, 10k-15k/piece of kimsa dumplings.

After buying, bring the stone benches to Ninh Kieu wharf to eat and admire the scenery. There are cruise ships on the river, the menu is a bit high (drinks 110k-140k, hotpot 3xx-400k...). After buying water, sitting on a chill cruise is fine. There should be one trip in the evening around 7:00 a.m. - 7:30 p.m

At the beginning of Can Tho market, there was a stall selling anime models. My lover was there struggling to choose for 2 hours. I saw a lot of young men coming in to choose. When buying, remember to pay the price because the seller quotes a fake price. After asking the price, be careful not to miss out.

In the evening, take a cool tour of the city center and then return to your room to rest. Only had 1 night in Can Tho so I didn't experience many places.
        Thanh Phong Nguy·ªÖn Ho√†ng: Yesterday, September 1, 2024, I stopped by and visited Ninh Kieu Wharf

        L∆∞·ª£ng Thi√™n X√≠ch (L∆∞·ª£ng Thi√™n X√≠ch): With its peaceful and poetic beauty in the modern city of Can Tho, Ninh Kieu wharf is considered a cultural symbol of Tay Do. This place has a strong Southern identity and is associated with the image of boats on the river bustling with buying and selling at the floating market.

This wharf is located on the right bank of Hau River, in Tan An ward, Ninh Kieu district, Can Tho city. It is located between the confluence of Hau River and Can Tho River, so it was once considered a goods trading dock during the French colonial period. Until now, people have not found any official documents recording the history of this location. Just know that according to an anecdote, this place used to be a river wharf at the beginning of Can Tho market.
        Chung Oanh: Near the wharf there are many places to experience and entertain, the closest is Can Tho market, which is more fun at night because there is a night market selling a lot of food and drinks. Along the wharf, there is also a cool walking street, suitable for strolling and enjoying the breeze. Around the wharf there are also relics that can be visited in the morning
        V∆∞∆°ng Thu H√†: Ninh Kieu Wharf is not what I thought üòÇ it's just a riverside road, quite small and nothing special, a few groups of street performers, but not very attractive. The food is different from the region so it doesn't suit your taste ‚Ä¶
        Minh Pham: Places to visit and have fun at night for tourists and local people.
Here you can enjoy snacks, restaurants on the river, bars.... and visit the bridge of love.
In particular, you can buy individual tickets to visit Cai Rang floating market at Ninh Kieu wharf.
The atmosphere here is very cheerful.
        NEUAN: "Stop at Ninh Kieu wharf via Can Tho bridge
Connecting the two banks of Hau Giang river
Soc Trang waits to hear the advertisement

A verse that captivates listeners about a famous place, in the busiest and most developed city in the Mekong Delta and beyond... The beauty of the land of white rice and clear water truly deserves its name. capital of the western region, urban area of the river region. This is a tourist destination that attracts both domestic and foreign tourists to visit. There's nothing more to say, when everything around meets your expectations. If I have a chance, I will still come back to visit this place, it's worth staying for a few days to visit this city‚ù§Ô∏è
