place: WIMI Coffee and Tea NVC
    Kellie: This coffee shop is a hidden gem with a plethora of views. Whether you prefer cityscapes, greenery, or a cozy corner, there's a seat for every preference.
    Tr∆∞·ªùng Khoa Nguy·ªÖn: Drink: not bad
    Service: we ordered 11 drinks and cost about 400k but owner said we too noisy other cant study. I suggest if others want to study, go home and so your home work. Not at the coffee shop.
    Atmosphere: Aircon did not on untill we enter the area. Some lighting was off => so store not as good as the review on tiktok.
    Will not come back again.
    B∆°: During the second time, I visited quite a few, so in general, the space is quiet and the water is delicious. It's very spacious. You should stop by the restaurantüíóü´∞ü´∞
    Sa Yuri: - Sometimes my younger siblings keep asking me if there's a nice, quiet restaurant with cheap air conditioning that can seat a lot of people. I just recently discovered a new cafe with a beautiful view that specializes in working, studying, and meeting deadlines, especially with super long tables that can seat up to 10 to 20 people, especially for group study students üòçüòçmeets the required standards.
        - The restaurant space is spacious, quiet, especially with 3 floors, so you don't have to worry about running out of seats.
        - The day I visited the shop, I ordered WIMi Roasted Milk Tea which was quite delicious, especially the grasshopper pearlsü§§
        -Many desks comfortably meet deadlines

        #wimicoffeeandteaNVC #cantho #sticky rice
    Huynh Hieu Travel: The cafe is spacious, has many seats and many electrical outlets. A place designed for students and workers to meditate. The shop is open until about 3am, with food available.
    ƒê√†m V√µ B·ª≠u Tr√¢n: Coffee shop with beautiful space and children's play area. Many luxurious shooting angles. Enthusiastic friendly staff. However, the taste of the water is not to my liking and the price is a bit high (probably to cover the cost).
    david kim: The restaurant has bad service and the staff sees customers standing there looking like aliens.
        The drinks are so bad
        Have a beautiful, comfortable space.
        The price is not low but the service is too bad
    Duc Duy Pham: ‚úÖ Comfortable, cool space, soft seats, good music
        ‚úÖ A variety of delicious drinks and coffee
        ‚úÖ Very fast service, no noise
        ‚úÖ Food can be brought in from outside
        ‚õîÔ∏è Price is a bit steep
    Í≥†ÎØºÍ≥†ÎØºÌïòÏßÄÎßà: The main customer base is students and office workers, so there are quite a lot of customers, but it is also spacious with three floors, so you can spend time comfortably.
        The price of the cafe is on the expensive side at 30,000 dong, but since most of the customers are working, I think it is reasonable considering it is a place price.
        The coffee was made using a machine, but it tastes just as good. Recommended for those who like coffee with a bitter aftertaste.
        The Wi-Fi speed is 30MB, which is faster than my house, so I am satisfied.
        If you are looking for a quiet space to work, come here.
    Mai Tr√∫c Nguy·ªÖn: Spacious and airy space. There are sockets at the table. Reasonable service price. At some tables, I felt the light was shining directly from above, so when I was writing, it was shadowed. Everything else is fine
    Linh Kona Life: A suitable place to sit and concentrate on work
    Hoa Nguyen: The space is spacious, because the style is suitable for many people, it is a very good place for group meetings...
    Huu Nguyen: The space is spacious, bright and clean.
        Large 2-wheel parking area
        Drink quality is normal.
    Nh·∫≠t Tr·∫ßn: Spacious restaurant, large parking space. Drinks are fine, there is an animal picker machine in the shop :>
    Ho√†i L√™: Surprised by this restaurant. I thought coming here would hurt my wallet because it's so luxurious, but the price is not very reasonable. Delicious and modern drinks. Seeing how the staff makes your glass of water always gives you peace of mind about cleanliness. Now let's see the owner make a great cappuccino ‚ù§Ô∏è
    Ph∆∞·ªõc ƒêinh: What kind of service does this restaurant have that leaves the car covered in paint and even uses a towel to scratch the car? Seeing no apology or explanation. The morning of July 31, 3024
    Ho√†i Phong L√™: Order 2 glasses of water and wait 40 minutes. I've never seen a restaurant that serves as long as this one.
    NHI HOANG: Nice shop. The drinks are okay and delicious
    L√™ T√¢m: Spacious space, good drinks, reasonable prices.
    Tran Thi Kim Phung: Today around 3:00 p.m. I went to the shop
        The first time I went to the restaurant, I felt that the attitude of the staff member ordering me was not very respectful, talking without even looking at the customer's face, without even bothering to say hello (I don't know if that was the restaurant's policy or not) and had a very bad attitude.
        I hope the shop will fix this problem!
    T√≤n Ten: Spacious restaurant, beautiful tables and chairs.
        The mixed drink is not very good but the price seems a bit expensive.
        The staff doesn't seem very friendly.
        The toilet is quite dirty.
    Toan Chau Tri: Quiet, suitable for pupils, students or office workers.
    KIM THANH D∆Ø∆†NG: I went to the shop and ordered hand-pounded lemon tea. It was sour and didn't taste like hand-pounded lemon tea. There are a lot of lemon seeds, so don't remove them when preparing. Another minus point is that the shop is large, has a frontage, and serves on-site but serves plastic cups and does not have its own iced tea cups. The air is not fresh.
    Beyond The Memory: CHILL BAR, ESPECIALLY NO MUSIC AT DARK, TOO QUIET EXPERIENCE TOO GREAT TOO CLASS
    Mai Th·∫£o L√™ Ph·∫°m: The space is spacious and airy, there is an area for you to study and work very well, a place to chat is also ok, the water price is mid-range.
    Diem Hoang: Cool roof room, comfortable seating. The price is not cheap but cheap ingredients are used to prepare the drink
    y·∫øn nguy·ªÖn: The space of the shop is suitable for students, delicious and affordable drinks, 24/24 operation, very okay for students to run Deadline: 333 The staff here are very cute.
    Holo Hola: My experience at wimi NVC was very bad, from space to service and hygiene.
        - The space of the restaurant is wide, which is ok, but on the 3rd floor, the lights are said to shine straight into the face, most of the white lights sitting at many remote control sources shine straight into the face. Besides, there is no SUN:)))
        - Cleaning the restaurant takes a long time, I rarely see the staff cleaning up.
        - and especially the toilets, 3 of the 3 rooms are dirty, newly built but they look old. Then suddenly, the air conditioner was installed and connected to both men's and women's restrooms, with the same hole. Look up and see, the other side is coughing and you can still hear it :))
        It's really BAD, the tree is about to die. Ulatr
    Nhi Hu·ª≥nh tri·ªáu √Ω: Drinks are fine, the space is spacious, suitable for students running deadlines, and the shop is very quiet
    ƒêo√†n Y·∫øn Vi Ph·∫°m: Spacious space suitable for studying alone or in groups, also suitable for chatting, price ranges from 40-50
    Bo L√™: The space is spacious but the staff's attitude is not very good
    Hau Pham: The air conditioner saves electricity or something, but doesn't turn it on to keep guests cool. The staff is very attentive.
    KSM/Minh Gaming: View is also quite ok
    Th∆∞ Minh: The drinking water is very good, the staff is okay. The air conditioner is very cold, the space is large.
    0139_ Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc Tr√¢m Anh: Coffee is very good, coming here is suitable for working and studying. Coming here is very motivating to work
    Tr·∫ßn Qu·ªëc Vi·ªát: A cafe working without music and without friends is a bit sad. Very crowded

    Th√†nh Tr√≠ Ng√¥: I haven't arrived yet so I don't know. If I have a chance, I will visit

    ƒê·∫Øc Ph∆∞·ªõc Nguy·ªÖn: Coffee street, cheap prices, cool space,
        It's a place to stop in the middle of bustling streets.
        Fragrant drink, excellent quality,
        Brings a warm, relaxing experience.
        Sitting by the window, watching the people flow by,
        Relax to gentle melodies.
        Open space, shady green trees,
        Helps our soul become more peaceful.
        Rich menu, from coffee to tea,
        Every sip brings a little joy.
        With friends, sharing stories,
        A peaceful place, where we find ourselves.
        Coffee street, where hearts connect,
        In the midst of life's chaos, you can still find joy.
        Cheap price but quality, close space,
        A perfect choice for those who love.
    Spring tran: Delicious, cheap cafe with cool space

place: M·ªôc Nhi√™n Coffee
    Huey Quan: Very chilled coffee spot, nice all wood deco, it has three level, with comfy sofa seating. Prices are ok too, Vietnam iced coffee is 30k, while tiramisu costs 35k
    Miroslav Lazic (Miki): Awesome Awesome awesome üòç one of the best spots in the city. Wonderful overall experience. If google would allow, I'd rate it 7* out of 5*.
    Dr De: Found this place by accident and took a liking to the design of this place. Drinks are so so for this price point, need improvement to promote the brand.
    Love Faith Hope: Wonderful place to hang out üåª‚ò∫Ô∏è ‚Ä¶
    Phat Nguyen: Awesome place, have many plants, feeling so fresh. You could play a board game or gamble.

    Linh Kona Life: Moc Nhien has a beautiful Christmas decoration space
        Lake frontage overlooking Cantho University
        An ideal place to work, diverse menu
        Linh Kona reviews
    Nguy·ªÖn Ho√†ng Duy: The drinks are good, the space is well invested, the staff is good, there is parking, suitable for those who want a quiet place to chat on the weekend, freelancers working here are very ideal, Reasonable price, if you sit all day, order 2 or 3 glasses to drink freely. Location is easy to find. The owner must be very dedicated and spend a lot of money on decoration, so he can come often without fear of getting bored.
    Tri·ªÅu D∆∞∆°ng: I visited in mid-September 2024, in a few days it will be Mid-Autumn Festival, so the shop is decorated with all kinds of lanterns quite beautifully.
        The design inside the shop is quite beautiful, with many large Fern trees and arch-shaped wood.
        Roasted and ground coffee beans brewed in the machine have a common flavor, nothing special.
        The space is more suitable for groups of friends than couples.
        I saw about 4-5 employees inside the shop, including cashiers, PCs, and service staff. I drank all the tea and couldn't see any more tea, nor did I see them coming to pour tea for other tables. The price of water is not cheap, although the layout of the photography corner is not much.
    Nguy·ªÖn Ph∆∞∆°ng Ng·ªçc: The Christmas decor is very nice, delicious drinks, friendly staff
    Ti·∫øn L√¢m Tr·ªçng: Delicious water, lovely polite staff, cool air conditioner, chill musicüíïüíïü•∞
    Minh Ngoc: Natural, a warm and very poetic space of the Western river. Thank you guide. A wonderful evening!
    Olivia Smith (Annie Nguyen): Delicious water, many different types, beautiful space to study and work. The price of water fluctuates around 35-50k, which in my opinion is a bit higher than other shops, but the mixed fruit juice is quite delicious so you can try to imitate it. One limitation is that there is no car parking space, right across the street there can be a maximum of 3 cars with 7 seats.
    Trang Tran: The decor is stylish, beautiful, friendly and extremely thoughtful. Will stop by again when coming to Can Tho
    Siphus: The drinks are moderately delicious, the restaurant space is spacious and beautiful
    Cu Ru: If you love nature, want to enjoy coffee and need peace and quiet, Moc Nhien is the ideal place, the price is very reasonable, not too expensive, the space is green and cloudy. Service is friendly and very enthusiastic.  It's a very suitable place to meet friends, exchange work and even family members!
    Mya Kaming: Compared to the average, water prices are slightly higher.
        In return, the shop's space is very invested, from the ceiling, walls, trees to the decoration of water glasses.
        The shop is not big but has many floors and lots of space.
        Cool air conditioning, enthusiastic staff and quick preparation.
        Overall, I really like this restaurant, it's very stable. It's a pity that I haven't been able to visit everything yet.
        Will come back.
        Must-try
    Do Thi Phuong Thao: Recently, there are often groups of young people coming to talk loudly, affecting the people around them. One day my family could only sit for about 30 minutes before having to leave because the table next to us was playing cards and laughing loudly. I hope the staff will take the trouble to warn groups that are too noisy to avoid affecting others.
    Lƒ©nh Nguy·ªÖn Tr·ªçng (Lƒ©nh Lƒ©nh): - Staff: The staff here are lovely, especially the security guard who is extremely cute... I will come here to drink again because of the security guard, hehe
        - About the water: the water is very delicious, I recommend everyone to drink milk tea, it's delicious, everyone
        - about space: we came here to take beautiful photos, the trees here are very beautiful, everyone, don't pull the tree, it will turn ugly. Hey, it's so beautiful upstairs. Why don't you go upstairs and take pictures?
        - Coming here to play games to study or play cards or check in is all reasonable, everyone
        - The view of the shop is mainly brown and green, everyone
    Nguy·ªÖn Duy Kh√°nh: The shop is beautiful, quiet, cool, the drinks are quite good, the shop is clean, the security guards are very cute. Suitable for work and study
    Trang Huy·ªÅn: Moc Nhien Cofee is a great place to drink with healthy drinks. The water in the shop is very fresh, full of vitamins and reduces the feeling of fatigue. The space in the restaurant is spacious and clean, creating a comfortable feeling for customers. The staff in the restaurant are very enthusiastic and dedicated, supporting customers in the best way. The price of water at the restaurant is also very reasonable and suitable for customers' budgets. I highly recommend the cafe and recommend you try it once if you want to find a place to drink healthy water.
    Ph√πng B·∫£o Xuy√™n: The shop's Christmas decorations are extremely beautiful, the shop space is not large but has invested in reasonable decoration and layout, not too crammed. I haven't had a drink yet, but I already fell in love with the beautiful shop. Guava tea is quite ok.
    D∆∞∆°ng Th√πy: Fun staff, delicious drinks, beautiful set up
    Nh∆∞ Hu·ª≥nh Nguy·ªÖn: I've visited the restaurant a few times during holidays like bth and always found the service to be good, but the number of times I've ordered the same type each time, it's not so great. But the decor vs space is 10 VND, there is no such thing, the air conditioner is always cool, but during holidays it gets a bit crowded so those who like quiet should take note.
    Thai MX: The restaurant has a nice view, air-conditioned space, enthusiastic and friendly staff, ok drinks, prices are a bit high
    Son Thi Thuy Trang: 1. Spacious space, great view. There are many shooting angles.
        2. Water prices are quite high, but worth it for the service and space here.
        3. Bonus points for being overly protective.
        From alley 51, go straight near the end of the street and you will see the shop. Quite far.
    Nguy·ªÖn Ho√†ng Minh Huy: I came to the restaurant on Christmas, the decoration is super good, the drinks are delicious and suitable for the budget, the staff is very friendly and polite, the parking lot of the restaurant is spacious, the way to get to the restaurant is also very easy if there is a chance. Please come and experience it, overall the restaurant is very good
    Duoc Tran: I went to the shop. This is a suitable place for everyone, gathering friends, studying, working,... the drinks are quite good, the space is spacious and cool.
    Nham Le: Delicious drink: try both coffee and cocoa cheese 9/10
        Staff: Service attitude is very enthusiastic, cheerful and smiling. 10/10
        Beautiful view: cool, green trees 9/10
        Toilet: Cleanliness 8/10
        Parking space is spacious, big cars are a bit slow
    nguy·ªÖn ph√∫: The restaurant has a super nice interior decoration and reasonably priced drinks. There is also a beautiful, cool rooftop.
        Great decor, good drinks, affordable prices.
    H·ªì B√© Linh: In the evening to discuss business with the baby, the two sisters stopped by Moc Nhien, a shop mainly designed with wood, honeycomb-oriented structure combined with warm yellow lights and green plants. Inside there are large and small tables suitable for quiet work.
    D∆∞∆°ng Nh√£ VƒÉn: The first time we came to the restaurant, our group was a bit shy but still very polite, but the ordering staff was very polite towards us.
    Ho√†ng Ph∆∞∆°ng L√™: Our group was traveling with many people, so it took a little while to order, but the staff showed their attitude right away. Wait for us to leave and show your attitude that you're okay. Why are you like this? Quite disappointing.
    TriÃ£nh Khanh: The shop is very beautiful, many different spaces, order at the counter, there are staff serving drinks at the table, the shop is a place to gather friends to play red and black, the shop has many trees, decoration changes according to events and holidays, ok staff, large parking lot, but no cover, it gets wet after rain, the location is very easy to find. Water price from 27k or more. Cakes are available. Can eat and drink at the restaurant
    Nguy·ªÖn Qu·ªëc Vinh: About Space‚Äù
        Just once you set foot in the shop, you will immediately be delighted with the shop's unique decor. The gentle and mellow beauty is like being lost in the House üè† of the spirits in wonderland.                                                         Everything is so exciting for the type of person who loves to explore new things!
        üåøMoc Nhien also has an open space with a green garden, planted with many trees. Those who like to sit at the outdoor view feel like they are in harmony with the nature of Dalat. Every corner of the picture is sparkling.
        üç± About Moc Nhien's menu
        ‚òòÔ∏èVery diverse from traditional dishes to modern dishes. What's special is that Moc Nhien chooses fresh fruits to ensure the health and safety of Moc Nhien's guests. And we can't forget the delicious Panna cotta cake made by Moc Nhien's house üòã
        Moc Nhien hopes to be a long-term destination that accompanies work, study, beautiful memories of love, meetings with friends and relaxation with family ‚ù§Ô∏è
    Jackie Ph∆∞∆°ng: Discover the "honeycomb" style cafe with modern, youthful wooden design near the shore of Bung Xang lake üòö

        Drinks are quite delicious, only from 25k, everyone.
    Quang Le: The shop has a beautiful, unique design in Da Lat style, friendly staff, service staff, diverse payments such as momo,...
        The drink is quite ordinary, not very special, moderately priced, with parking on the ground floor
        On weekends, it is quite crowded and noisy due to children running around, customers who go to coffee shops are too conscious and let their children run around screaming.
    Nha Le: So cute!
        The restaurant is delicious and beautiful
        It takes a bit of time to order and pay, but it's okay to make up for the comfortable space :))

    T·∫§N NGUY·ªÑN: Life becomes more difficult when we live for others, but it also becomes more beautiful and happier.
    The greatest happiness in life is the firm belief that we are loved - loved for ourselves, or rather loved regardless of the next half of your life.
    Ph·∫°m Kim Tr√¢n: The Christmas decorations are very elaborate and the shop is also cute üíó
    H·∫≠u Tr·∫ßn Tr·ªçng: Beautiful scenery, an ideal place to go on a date with your lover or friends

    Gia Huy: Very cool, very good experience
        From the security guard, the staff, the atmosphere, the decoration, the space is very satisfactory
        If you need quiet after many hours of work or choose a place to work, study, or meet friends, it is very suitable.
        For those who love beautiful scenery, nature, and chill things, that's also a good choice here
        Well worth your visit!!!
    Th√°i B√πi: The glass space is air-conditioned but the green deco is very comfortable.
        It looks cramped from the outside, but when you get inside it's like being in a garden
        Mid-Autumn Festival also increases the number of lights for children to travel with.
    Ng·ªçc B√πi: Nice Christmas night restaurant. Bad service staff. The hot liptop cup took 1 hour to bring out. The water must have been cold on Christmas night so it took 1 hour to cook
    Kim Ng√¢n Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã: Genuine restaurant with beautiful view, enthusiastic staff
    Ngoc Nham: I went right when the shop was playing remix music, which was very loud and didn't fit the shop's atmosphere at all. Going to a restaurant for a relaxing drink but thinking I'm in a bar üôÇ
    HI MYNAMEISAIR: Unique space. Nice decoration, very "green" theme
    Hi·∫øu Thu·∫≠n H·ªì: Drinks are normal, due to the structure of the restaurant, it is difficult to call the staff. You cannot eat food in the room, you have to go out to eat. Overall feeling is not too bad but not satisfied either
    Phuong Le: Beautiful shop ‚ù§Ô∏è
    Long Tr·∫ßn: If one day you have the opportunity to pass by Bung Xang Lake, you should try this place, the shop is beautifully decorated with pine wood and green trees, especially tall and green ferns. I give a score of 10 for the design of the shop. Personally, I think the drinks are quite good and the service is also very good. The shop is often crowded in the evening. On the rooftop you can enjoy a beautiful view of the lake.
    trong phan: Genuine packaging
    Hu·ª≥nh T√¥n Ph√°t: Very crowded, good service, good prices
    ngan le: Moc Nhien is one of the cafes that I think of first when I intend to go with friends. Naturally there is a pleasant space in the room suitable for studying and working in groups. However, I like the terrace space more, when sitting on the terrace you will see the panoramic view of the area behind CTU, Vincom Xuan Khanh and Muong Thanh Hotel, besides on clear days you can see the view. The night sky view is wonderful. However, the price of water ranges from 30 to 50 twigs, and the water quality I rate is average to good.
    Li√™m Ng√¥: The restaurant has beautiful decor, natural style, delicious drinks, reasonable prices
    Nh∆∞ √ù: The restaurant space is beautiful with lots of green trees, the drink menu is not very diverse
    le cuong: The restaurant is ok. Reasonable price compared to experience. Happy service. The space is beautiful and airy
    Vy: The drinks are delicious, just to my taste, the service staff is attentive and especially the restaurant space is so beautiful.

        Beautifully decorated, creating a comfortable feeling like being in harmony with nature
    ·∫¢nh Ph·∫°m: The shop is very beautiful so the price is a bit expensive
    Nhan: The water is terrible, too sweet, the staff drinks too much iced tea, it's very annoying to interrupt people's conversations, the bathroom is very unhygienic, in general it's not good.
    Trang Hu·ª≥nh: Beautiful restaurant, delicious and cheap food
    EVNSPC: SANITATION is not good because: Too many flies

    Lam Van Phuoc: The restaurant has a spacious parking lot, airy space, the lemonade in the bottle is also delicate, but while I was drinking the car juice that was still in the parking lot, the staff came to collect money in advance because of the end of the shift, which was unacceptable, while I was still sitting and drinking.

    ƒê·ª©c Thu·∫≠n B√πi: The space is good, airy, and quite quiet. If you want to study or need quiet, you can refer to this shop. The water is also quite ok, I bought milk tea and found a lot of toppings, delicious taste, the wait wasn't too long. I'm a bit sorry because for such a good restaurant like this, the parking space is a bit limited. Having more parking space in the future would be quite ok, the staff are also very enthusiastic. The shop's theme is about bears, so if you like cute places, you should try it out
    Ashaya Ward: I often hang out at Gummy Cafe, the place is comfortable, there is a prayer room too, so I don't need to worry about having meetings or assignments there, free Wi-Fi too, so if you want to be alone you don't have to worry if you run out of quota

    Tuxx Nguyen: What a place. Huge with this location. Very packed. Lots of people aka students. First the parking for bike so dark and into an alley. Walk around to get in to the place.
        üò° Two 2 different prices on the menu. As in pictures. How hard it is to fix it. Don't like it at all. Cover the above price then.
        Hard to find a seat because each one is one table for it self.
        Internet not that fast either.
        Not again
        Oh yeah a little pricey for it though
    Dung Dang: The drink isn't very special but for overall it is the best coffee shop for studying and working in Can Tho

        Strong wifi. Ok water.
    Nancy travelwith: Advantages: the decor has many scenes to take Tet photos, the restaurant is spacious, there are many tables and chairs and is airy. If you don't take Tet photos, it's still cool on weekdays.
        Disadvantages:
        ‚ùóÔ∏èI still remember clearly that on the morning of the first day of Tet last year, there was only one employee working, so he was taking orders and mixing. My family brought adults to see this and welcomed their friends. Actually, the human resources during Tet are not allowed in a relatively large restaurant and there is no music so talking will be a bit noisy.
        ‚ùóÔ∏èThe parking space is small if you go crowded
        ‚ùóÔ∏èThe water is temporary but not delicious because I drank many types of tea and coffee that day, not just one type
    pha le huynh: The water I drank was peach chrysanthemum tea, medium sweet, when I drank it, I felt the smell of chrysanthemum mixed with peach tea, the topping was 2 pieces of peach 32k cups, here, in my opinion, it is for working and studying, because most young people study a lot, it is also spacious and clean, I went in the evening, so I went outside to sit but there were a few mosquitoes.
    M·ªπ Ti√™n T·ªëng: The restaurant is spacious and airy
        Having a power outlet for working or studying is quite convenient
        Delicious water, more variety of drinks is even better
        Elegant and comfortable decoration
        Parking a car is a bit difficult
        Arrange many strange spaces
        There are stuffed animals for babies
    H√πynh Thi√™n Ph·∫°m: The 80s drinks are quite ok, the view is good for studying
    Nh∆∞ Nguy·ªÖn: The shop is open 24 hours but at night the air conditioning is turned off and the toilets are dirty and smelly and the staff doesn't clean them.
        The restaurant is crowded so the wifi is extremely laggy.
        The staff has a rude attitude, always talking, and guests don't even say hello. Arbitrarily cleaning the customer's table even though I bought drinks at the restaurant.
        Sweet drinks. High price
        Large space but noisy. There is a playlist that keeps repeating all the time.
    L√™ Nh√¢n Mekong Delta: Similar to the branch in Mac Thien Tich. Here the space is spacious and airy. Main focus is on working space for students and office workers to have a place to work. This place has a variety of seats. There are flat chairs, high tables... Electrical outlets are equipped everywhere, very convenient. If you don't have enough, you can borrow more from the shop
    Gi√°m ƒê·ªëc Tr√£i Nghi·ªám Kh√°ch H√†ng L√ä NH∆Ø H·∫†NH: The first time I came to the shop, before entering the shop, there was no parking attendant. Entering the restaurant to order, the bartender at 9:40 a.m. on May 22, the senior member of the crew, greeted customers with a cold face.

        When I came inside and sat at a table that didn't have a table sign, the same bartender came over and gave me a glass of water, saying: This table is already booked, then turned around and left, giving up.

    Minh Kh√¥i: The drink is delicious but a bit sweet. There is a variety of drinks and reasonable prices.
        The space is airy, with many tables and electrical outlets suitable for working and studying.
        There is parking and valet parking.
        Staff ok.
    Th·∫£o Vi Nguy·ªÖn: 4:00 p.m. October 25, 2024 Upstairs, the room is as noisy as a market. Going to the shop to study is like sitting in a torture room, extremely uncomfortableüôÉüôÉüôÉ
    NHI HOANG: Great place to meet friends, work, study or check in
    Mai Tr√∫c Nguy·ªÖn: Spacious and airy space. White light makes it easy to study. The shop is open 24 hours. The drinks are okay, not too great. Food allowed. Suitable for group study
    Tr√¨nh ƒê·ªó ƒêƒÉng: Cool and spacious.  24h/24h. Study the ideal lesson.  Full sockets.  Quite crowded, sometimes lacking seats.
    ƒêo√†n Ng√¢n: Employees joke and make noise, dropping glasses, affecting others.
    Nhi ƒê√†o: Cafe to study for deadlines for students, so it's very crowded and has a large space for group work
    HUY·ªÄN TRUNG T√ÇM NH·∫¨T NG·ªÆ MIDORI: The space is airy, especially with many tables for studying, each table has its own power outlet for using laptops. When there are a bit more guests, it gets a bit hot, perhaps because the space is too open.
    Tr·∫ßn V≈© Ch∆∞∆°ng: I also quite like this shop. It's a place I often go to when I need to work on my laptop, for more than a year now. I rate the restaurant as ok, giving it all 5 stars. But I feel like this is not right. From the beginning of July until now, I have visited the restaurant twice in the morning, and both times there were 2 older women entering the restaurant to ask customers for money (begging style). One time on Sunday morning (July 14), a woman about 50-60 years old came to each table, cried, begged, asked for money from each table. Just 2 days later, today (July 16), another girl of the same age also stopped by each table, tilting her hat and asking customers for money. I found it a bit strange because the shop was located in a closed space but those people opened the door very naturally. I saw some people selling lottery tickets not even daring to go in. I don't understand how beggars can come in and out so naturally. I noticed that the staff also felt strange, so I thought about inviting those two girls out, but maybe they were shy. The restaurant should tell the staff to be tough with people like that (because I know they are just taking advantage of kindness, maybe the students who are tempted to give money will be poorer than those girls). I have a small suggestion, the shop can post a sign "Lottery ticket sellers, please do not enter the shop" at the door to prevent this situation. Sincerely give your feedback!
    M·ªπ Ti√™n Tr·∫ßn: The space is large, cool, clean.
    giang cao ho√†ng: January 27, 2023 I went to the shop early and left at 5:11 AM. After sitting for a while, I went to the toilet and I saw the sink like this! I don't know who unconsciously created the "scene". But I called the staff in to see how to limit what's in the picture. Because I find the restaurant's toilet aesthetic "very disgusting" and "very disgusting" because of the strong smell. After a while, about 2 hours later, when I went back to the toilet, it was still the same as the picture. So I went home because I didn't dare wash my face to stay awake when I saw that. I would like to correct this, "it's not the shop's fault", it's because someone "wasn't aware" of the sink for vomiting and the sink for washing hands! Hopefully the shop will improve and develop more!! Wishing the pink shop prosperity!!
    Minh Kh√¥i H·ªì: The network is too weak, not suitable for work.
    Mrs. Diem: The cafe has a meeting room. Convenient, spacious

    D∆∞∆°ng Nguy·ªÖn: East is the first, every table in the restaurant is empty but it is reserved, choose a table to sit at, the waiter calls that this table has people booked so he goes downstairs to sit down and there is no other table left. Funny

    Qu·ªëc Huy: It's not very good, but it's ok for studying or playing
    Tr·∫ßn H·ªØu L·ªôc 26-02-02: This afternoon I stopped by the restaurant. When I finished ordering my drink, I saw that the table was empty and there was no table reservation. I put my things and sat down when a male employee ran over and said that this table had a reservation (I was also a customer, so I sat at my table first, so why did I want to find another table?) Then I was fine and looked for another table. After I went down, I saw the place where the employee said it was a customer's reservation and that person was sitting. The restaurant staff reserved the table for the customer. I was quite disappointed and I will never use it again. Now visit the shop again

    Ph√∫c Nguy·ªÖn Ho√†ng Minh: Delicious milk tea, beautiful space

    T√≤n Ten: The restaurant is spacious, has parking open 24/7, so it is suitable for students working in the office.
        But the wifi is a bit weak and the drinks are not very good. Hopefully the improved restaurant will be perfect!
    Huynh Hieu Travel: The shop has a large interior space, with many places to work. It's quite attractive to have a few dedicated spaces for working alone or in groups.

Can Tho, this is the second branch of the shop, the shop has a very interesting study space, the shop is quite crowded so the space is a bit noisy, prices range from 24 - 36k, however in my opinion the water is of good quality. It's only temporary but not delicious, which is why I rate it 4 stars. Are you a student in the city? If you don't know about this restaurant in Can Tho, you can come and experience it. Hope you have a great experience here.

The shop has a parking attendant so it's quite neat. The service staff is also quite enthusiastic. However, it is not very professional. Drinks are also common and not special. The minus point and dissatisfaction is that the restaurant's nameplate is quite sketchy. The only view point of the restaurant is the balcony, which has not been given much attention......
    Th√¥ng Thai: I like this shop, I often drink hybrid tea for only 18k. The staff are friendly. Downstairs is cool, outside is ok but upstairs is a bit smelly.
    Minh Chi·∫øn ƒêo√†n: What can I say, the shop is designed in a new style combining a cold room and a garden suitable for all customers. With a large and airy garden space, suitable for fun conversations with friends and relatives.  Inside the cold room with a quiet design suitable for students to study and relax.  Especially at the shop, there is a promotion program of 10% off the total bill for pupils and students when operating at the shop from 7am to 7pm when checking in at the shop with hashtas maycoffe.
    Kanae Kocho: Overbearing staff attitude, average food but very expensive. Really bad
    Yang h·ªì ·∫øch: Nice shop. Service staff ok. Food and drink. Tasty

    C√îNG TY NGON-B·ªî-R·∫∫: The breakfast is very delicious,
        clean,
        quick service,
        Enthusiastic and thoughtful staff arrange food and drinks politely.
        In particular, the boss is probably under 70, welcomes guests politely, cheerfully, and drives the bus attentively.
        Overall 5 star service. Can't fault it at all
        The food is delicious, delicious, big and small, everyone can eat delicious food, no one can criticize it.
        First time going to Can Tho, had a great breakfast experience.
        Recommend everyone to come here for breakfast.
        There is enough coffee and drinking water.

    VNPT VINAPHONE C·∫¶N TH∆†: Very delicious cafe, new space, cheerful staff
    Í≥†ÎØºÍ≥†ÎØºÌïòÏßÄÎßà: A coffee shop that also offers meals.
        A bitter coffee with a subtle coffee aroma. This kind of coffee is only edible once the ice and sugar have melted, so drink it slowly and savor it.
        The man Baobe who cleans up the motorcycles in front also manages parking and serves drinks as he is busy. The rest of the employees are also busy and the quality of service is not good, but it is understandable. How about hiring more staff?
    NHI HOANG: Temporarily okay with the price. Poor service staff, unpleasant and unpleasant faces

    Huy Trung: It's beautiful, the music is a bit loud, the cf is okay
    Mint: The shop is quite hot... Even though there are 3 air conditioners. Regarding the layout, the floor is not beautiful, just a layer of cement paste. The water is quite okay. Nice clean restroom. In terms of space, the outdoor area is spacious, but the indoor area is the opposite, quite cramped. Not very quiet.
    Duy Nguyen: Why is the restaurant so strange?. In the past, there was broken rice, noodle soup, and beef noodle soup, but now they no longer exist. 3 dishes that made an impression. Now where have they gone? I will never come back!!!
    Lam Uyen: The restaurant is airy and quiet, suitable for studying, meeting friends, delicious drinks, diverse breakfast, reasonable prices.

        ‚úÖ Enthusiastic vehicle security
        ‚õîÔ∏è Take the time to invest in some music, listen to popular music and have YouTube ads, the staff are huddled together a bit absentmindedly.
    Th√°i H∆∞ng Nguy·ªÖn: Large, spacious coffee shop, cool cold room, many types of drinks at reasonable prices, deliciously prepared. Coffee does not have rustic coffee, machine-brewed coffee. There are pastries and snacks, and on the first floor there is air-conditioned billiards.
    Buu Ho: Although the shop is located far from the city center, it is decorated quite modern and eye-catching, the price of drinks is quite reasonable, I find that the shop also sells some sweet and salty cakes that are okay to eat as a snack. Although the restaurant is crowded, the tables and chairs are arranged very reasonably so that everyone has their own space. Another plus point is that the power outlets are arranged quite conveniently for bringing laptops to study and work.
    Thanh B√¨nh Nguy·ªÖn: From the outside, the shop has security guards and ok, covered parking.
        The restaurant serves orders at the counter, behind a waiter, so it's comfortable and convenient.
        The space, tables and chairs are also carefully invested so I quite like it. There are many electrical outlets arranged so people like me who often use laptops like this place very much.
        Wc is at a relative level, temporarily okay.
        The sound part is because the shop, besides people studying in groups or working like me, also has many people playing games so it's not very quiet. The music is also quite arbitrary, mainly following trends, so I give this place a pretty good score.
        The price range is average, I ordered a glass of milk coffee for 24,000 VND.
        In terms of overall quality and price, it's not quite 5* but it's still ok so I vote to encourage it.
    Ho√†ng Nam Nguy·ªÖn: The restaurant is clean and bright, the staff is enthusiastic, the prices are acceptable, the drinks are delicious but a bit small.
    Danh Thanh T√¢m: The coffee shop has a beautiful, gentle, luxurious design. Suitable for young people meeting in groups or studying!

    Mai Khanh L√™ ƒêo√†n: The restaurant is beautiful, the dishes are quite delicious, and the prices are reasonable. Staff are very enthusiastic. Every time I come to the shop, I feel like I'm in the mood to work.
    Ph·∫°m V≈© Ng·ªçc Trinh: The space is quite large, suitable for studying and working. The water is fine, he is enthusiastic
    Ng√¥ Th·∫£o Nguy√™n: I was looking for a space to study and work, so Coffee Time Shop is very suitable in terms of lighting, layout, creating ventilation and comfort!
        However, guests coming to drink water at night are quite noisy! Should influence people who want to work!
        The shop's drinks have a wide range of coffee, tea, blended ice dishes, etc. My husband and I like to drink lychee tea and peach tea.
        I haven't tried coffee yet!
        The shop has cakes and reheats them for customers to eat. I had salted egg orchid which was quite delicious but a bit low in eggs! ü§£ü§£ü§£
        You should bring Headphones if you want to work and study!
    Khoa Nguy·ªÖn ƒêƒÉng: Good drinks, delicious cakes, mostly a comfortable space. The staff is happy and ok.
        The air conditioner is a bit cold and dry.
        It is recommended that the shop have more fruit juice üôè
    Ph·∫°m Thu√Ω Qu·ª≥nh 08-04-03: The shop is beautiful, the drinks are delicious... it's an ideal space to meet deadlines
    Hi·∫øu Th√°i: Air-conditioned, quiet space suitable for working and studying. Delicious drinks, cakes but not many options.
    ƒêƒÉng Khoa ƒê·ªó: I think this is a coffee shop worth experiencing. Maybe it will become your favorite shop. From the car attendant to the manager or whatever, he really cares about customers, proactively asks to help customers with their car, and the tea pot is always filled (sometimes you can ask the staff to fill it if he forgets). The restaurant's atmosphere is chill even when sitting in an air-conditioned room. The restaurant's background music is a piano without lyrics. I find the restaurant's customers polite and polite in keeping the space quiet. The restaurant staff is very cute. The restaurant deserves support from everyone. That's my experience. Thank you if any of you have read this far.

    An B√©: Our country's prices are considered averagely high compared to students, the shop is not a big brand, does not have many customers, customers should not be allowed to serve themselves while the staff sits and does not talk, this creates a bad mentality, is less friendly and inconvenient for customers! Peace!!

T       he shop is open until 11pm, I find the wifi is also strong. But when I went, the number of customers was not full, I don't know what the wifi will be like when it's full. Well, the shop has a computer that always listens to you guys!
    Long Anh M·ªπ L√™: Open space, if you like quiet or group work, go upstairs. Stay on the ground floor because it's near the bar so it's a bit noisy. The shop is clean and the water is okie.

        Delicious ice cream, make your own ice cream, add toppings as you like. The price of each item is 50k/100g, which is a bit high.

    H·ªìng Ng·ªçc: 158g is 79k guys, not a single piece has been deducted. Ice cream 50k/100g, weigh the toppings to calculate the price, do not tell the customer in advance. Add tapioca pearls and water chestnuts and weigh them while I didn't ask for extra toppings, resulting in a jar of ice cream worth 79k. Machine-made ice cream is not ice cream anymore. Much more expensive than on SG =))

    Oanh Nguy·ªÖn: Iced coffee is ok, but other preparations are both expensive and bad. Mango coconut milk is drunk with ice and can be sprayed with some mango syrup, the taste is terrible. As for tiramisu, mix it with fresh milk and a little tiramisu syrup... it's terribly boring
    Tuan Tran: Enthusiastic, cheerful and friendly staff 10 points
    Khang Bui Trong: This restaurant is so quiet, the drinks are delicious, and the wait staff are really cute. When you enter the shop, there will be someone to help guide the car and greet customers warmly. Cool study space. Overall great experience.

    My Y·∫øn (Mon): Find a place to watch fireworks. Booked in advance, the restaurant confirmed, but when I arrived there was no table, the staff said they didn't know about this reservation, and after ordering water for 2 hours, there was still no drinking water!

    H∆∞∆°ng B√©o: The shop has plenty of places to take photos, and the staff is nice and chatty. Delicious drink that suits my taste, can reduce the sweetness as required, and prepares quite quickly.
    Tr·∫ßn T√∫ Linh 13-12-03: Extremely bad experience at the restaurant today. There weren't so many customers that they had to wait 40 minutes for 2 glasses of water. :)) At first, around 15 minutes, I came to the girls and said, "Hey, do you have these two glasses?", the girls also told me to wait. I can wait until 40 minutes and still not have two drinks even though the people who came in later, I have to say that in front of me I see 5 or 6 people coming in a long time after me and still have water? If I don't mention it, I don't have a product. I have no opinion. I feel like sitting there for 40 minutes and no one cares? The cashier told the barista that "these two glasses are a bit long gone" but she still hasn't arrived after waiting for someone to pick them up and bring them back? Decided to throw away 2 glasses of water and will never come back because the service is so bad. Even if the restaurant finds that the customer's 2 glasses of water are not worth much, they should reconsider their way of doing things.
    Ng√¢n Tr√∫c: First and last time visiting this restaurant. Let's not talk about my glass of water that was a bit bad and a bit expensive + the table I sat at was not cleaned, I had to clean it myself ü•≤. The story is that when I placed the order, I still had some money left, but my friend said that if he had enough money, he would send it to me later, but by the time I sat down, he still hadn't given it to me, so I rushed home so I forgot. When I came back to pick it up, you said YOU'RE HAVING YOUR MONEY HABIT, then you said "WHY DON'T YOU REMIND ME", so it was the customer's fault for not reminding you of your money habit. You say that when you haven't checked yet :))) I asked to check the cam, but the guy asked me or something, then said nothing and then gave me the money back. I'm just a gentle person, but I'm not trying to make things difficult, but I have such an attitude, so I'm sorry

    Viet Nam Tube: One of the emerging caf√©s in recent times has been loved by many people who have a heavenly staircase.  The most prominent feature of that restaurant is the unique staircase architecture, completely above, so guests can enjoy the dishes, sip a cup of coffee, watch the romantic scenery  from the stairs.  Month only up to 2 people.  On weekends or evenings, the restaurant has been burning tables even though the campus is quite large.  The shop is designed in the classic style of Western elegant and cozy with Asian style.  Besides, the furniture is cleverly arranged to create a suitable space for you to chat.  This is a cool, cool and airy area.  Staff are cute and enthusiastic.  Mid-range food and drink.  I have taken more menus.  The cheapest is 10k spring water.
