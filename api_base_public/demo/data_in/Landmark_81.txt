		- Entity 360 (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): Nice decorations after refurbished.  Easy to in and out with your drink.  Right beside CGV, WC  Free wifi.
		- Cong Minh Doan (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-09-28): The Highlands Coffee branch at Landmark 81 has a relatively small space, which is understandable given the premium location within such an expensive building. Despite the compact area, the drinks maintain the brand's consistent quality, with the iced milk coffee standing out as particularly delicious. While the size of the venue might be a limitation, the coffee experience remains satisfying.
		- Anjay Kumar (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): Landmark 81 Highland Coffee, There are no professional coffee staff here.  I told her not to make it too sweet. She made it so sweet that my mouth was sticking to it. Thanks.
		- Ak (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): This Highlands coffee is located in the B1 floor of Landmark 81 shopping mall. There are some comfy seats here, but it‚Äôs a bit too noisy just like many other highlands coffee branches. There is a movie theater next to this store, and also many restaurants are in this floor.
		- Vincent Bahk (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-06-28): 11This highland coffee is the most beautiful shop among branches.  This is located on basement in vincom land mark81 which is the highest building in the saigon.  And this is in fromt of CGV Cinema.  If you want a killing time This will br  good option.  All staffs are kind..
		- Kris T (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): This place will fill your drink with ice whether you like it or not. Tried to complain but useless as they are not focusing on customer satisfaction but maximum profit. Very disappointed. Bad bad service. Will not cover again!
		- VinhTNK (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): good drink, but a little hot, medium prices
		- Balza Guy (2.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): I am a regular customer at Highland's for 13 years. Last week I went to Highlands at Landmark building a tried the new almond with coffee. I asked a large size. After 3 sips the drink was over and what I saw is a cup with minimum 80% ice. How is it possible to cheat your customers like that and ask 52,000 VND for this?? At Starbucks and Cong Cha this does not happen! Is the staff trained like this? Very disappointing. I already shared this bad experience with my contacts.
		- Tadd Pham (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): The hangout spot is right in the middle of the food court. Always busy with patrons.

		- Nguyen Luong Hung (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): Highlands Coffee is a chain of coffee and fast food stores in the Philippines, founded by David Thai in 1999. Like all other Highlands coffee shops, the coffee is delicious. Sit politely and elegantly. An ideal place to sip coffee and enjoy wonderful sandwiches and cakes. Besides, with exclusive roasting and blending secrets, it creates a very unique Highlands flavor, giving diners a very rich, delicately fragrant cup of coffee.  In addition to the irresistible flavor, the restaurant's space is a blend of traditional and modern, bold Vietnamese features, and the enthusiastic service attitude of the staff is also the factor that helps Highlands Coffee gain a foothold in the Vietnamese F&B market. today. I love Highlands Coffee ‚òï‚òïüòçüòç‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüíØüíØ
		- PC4 Gaming (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): On February 2, 2025, I had an experience at highland landmark 81. The space at the restaurant is open space so it's quite noisy, it's hard to hear the equipment vibrating when ordering, but there are staff here to clean up the seats after. when the customer finishes using it. I ordered ice milk filter, cookie ice cream and cape ice cream. When I received the dish, I was quite surprised that it did not look like the illustration. As for the ice cream, I rated the cookie ice cream as the best, while the cape ice cream looked like soup ice cream and was not very delicious. I recommend everyone to use cookie ice cream when coming to the Highlands. Even though it's quite crowded, the food still comes out very quickly.
		- Ng·ªçc B·∫£o Ch√¢u Nguy·ªÖn (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): I still really like Highlands Coffee because no matter where I am, the price is the same and has now expanded to many locations. Coffee combo with breadsticks is extremely convenient, only 45k 53k 55k.
		- Alejandro Gutierrez (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): The shop makes drinks quickly even though it's crowded. The restaurant has a beautiful location right in the basement of Landmark. Because the restaurant has a good location, the price will be slightly higher than outside but not significantly. Airy open space. Still delicious Highlands dishes. There is a waiter who always cleans up, that's what I like about this branch.
		- hong anh Nguyen (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Highlands is the Vietnamese coffee brand I like the most and drink the most. Have experienced many restaurants in SG. The restaurant space at Vincom Landmark 81 is spacious, with comfortable tables and chairs. Drinking and chatting while watching people pass by is also interesting üòÖ
		- PHAN PHUONG (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): Spacious and airy space Delicious drinks The waiters are enthusiastic and cheerful
		- NGUY·ªÑN PH∆Ø·ªöC TRUY·ªÄN (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): The staff focused on mixing and was a bit absent-minded and didn't take care of the customers. I waited for a long time at the counter before someone asked what he was using? At other branches, when I went to see customers, the employees were startled and quit what they were doing to greet the customers or asked the customers if they could wait a bit so they could order for me. However, the water here is mixed quite well so overall I still give it 5 stars üòõ
		- B√∫n B√≤ N·∫°m Ch·∫£ (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): -The price of size L cups here is higher than other stores. Yellow lotus is the dish I always choose when drinking Highland, because I find it suits my taste and other teas are not as good. -The staff is cheerful and friendly, making drinks very quickly even though the restaurant is a bit crowded. -Open space, located in the landmark basement.
		- Quang Hi·ªáp Li√™u (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-07-28): The shop is located in Landmark 81, spacious space, authentic Highlands drinks. Enthusiastic, cheerful staff, quick service. The child needed drawing paper, so I went to the counter to ask for a spare bill so he could draw on the back. The black-shirted employee at the water delivery area took a sheet of white A4 paper, 10 points was not available but üòç
		- Nguy√™n Minh L∆∞u (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): This is unsweetened fresh milk 65k or chocolate ice cubes 65k. Turning it up is the same as not turning it up
		- Ho√†ng Vi (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-10-28): The shop is located on the B1 floor of Vincom Landmark 81 Always crowded but the staff are very agile and professional.
		- Alexander Lehner (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): Hello first of all! So first we looked outside at the Star..... Double the price here! It tasted really good and was quick too!
		- Nguy·ªÖn Xu√¢n Ng√¢n Giang (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): haha today January 25, 2025 I accidentally spilled some water when I asked him to do it but he was surprised and asked "did I pour it all over?" Warranty for new one" thank you very much AC ü•≤ thank you for being so slow and friendly AC dth üíï

		- khanh ngoc (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-06-28): Hong Quyen staff has a senseless attitude towards customers Customers happily order. Staff: "Eat here or take away"? "59 thousand" The customer gave money, the staff returned it without saying a word. After giving it a look? Speech has no beginning, no ending, no subject or predicate. Impolite attitude Criticize the culture of shortness and self-love!
		- Khang V≈© (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): I like Highland because every location has beautiful design For me, yellow lotus tea is the best drink. Cheaper price than other competitors.
		- Nh∆∞ Tuy·∫øn Ng√¥ (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): This morning, I went to Highland to order bread and was informed that Highland stopped selling pork sandwiches and only had shredded chicken sandwiches left.  The pig farmer has lost again. Who dares to eat... Recently, I had to stop eating beef noodle soup in the alley, because the aunt selling noodle soup boiled pork trotters together.  p/s: I object to Highland selling Vietnamese coffee in plastic cups, so I have to order machine-brewed coffee to have ceramic cups.
		- Huynh Thienan (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): Very good.
		- Khanh Dinh (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Delicious brewed tea. Located on the B1 floor of landmark 81. Paying with Momo gets a 20-30% discount on the total bill.
		- Thanh Huu (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): The price is reasonable, the water here is delicious, the cake is not very good - This birthday is 10% off
		- Th·∫Øng Nguy·ªÖn (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-05-28): The quality of the food is ok, the atmosphere is comfortable, the price is a bit high
		- Ngoc Hong (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-09-28): An ideal place for relaxing coffee Delicious water, airy and comfortable space Suitable for dating or work
		- My life (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): The restaurant is a bit noisy because of the large number of customers and is right in the cgv cinema area, near the toilet area. The view is quite nice for those sitting behind the order counter. At the same time, those using computers should sit on the left side right at the cinema door or behind the counter because the electrical outlets in the rest of the places are broken or don't have much power. The service staff is very ok. In front there is a counter selling quite nice items for enthusiasts.
		- t√†i l√¢m (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): The person giving the cf has a bad attitude and talks nonsense.
		- Loan Ch√¢u Th·ªã (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): I don't know why the lotus tea here is so bad, it's light and has little cream, and there's also little water chestnut.
		- Triet Nguyen (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): I went to sit at a cafe here, my drink felt delicious as always üòÇ Why do I see so many people underestimating the service, probably because I haven't met the waiter yet üòÇüòÇ ‚Ä¶
		- L√™ ƒê·∫±ng (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): This chain is popular locally  It is located in landmark81  Prices do not change  Very like

		- Hunter Haw (2.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Saying no lotus seeds means no ice cream, the ordering staff should have listened clearly but made mistakes many times
		- tony tuan (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): THE SHOP IS LOCATED UNDER FLOOR B1, RIGHT ACROSS THE CGV MOVIE THEATER, NAMBENTO, HOTTO, CAPRICCIOSA, HONG KONG SHENG KEE DESSERT, BASKIN BR ROBBINS CREAM, KHAO LAO, RIGHT AWAY TO LANDMARK 81, NEAR THE escalator.
		- Kaz Hir (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): You can enjoy Vietnamese coffee anywhere in Vietnam, and here at Highlands Coffee, you can rest assured in terms of hygiene. Among them, the Landmark 81 store has a lot of seats and you can relax. The peach drink in the photo does not contain coffee, but please note that it is quite sweet.
		- Vi·ªát Nam Haloya (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-05-28): Hate any restaurant with bad wifi 1* no buts
		- MINH THU BUI (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Highland here is better than other branches
		- NhuAnhne (2.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): I'm quite disappointed with the quality of service I experienced today at HL Landmark. I ordered a large order for about 444k and had tea in it. I paid with a Napas card but the seller didn't get a 20k discount according to the program offered. I agree that 20k is not much, but when I asked, the staff said that if the customer wants a discount, they must tell the staff in advance???? Since when do customers have to remind customers about incentives offered by the brand itself???? I'd rather forget what you said to me, then I can sympathize, but the way you said it made me find it funny =))) My order was quite large so I asked the support staff to help carry it out for me. Even though the restaurant was quite empty, you refused to bring it to the table for us, causing us to struggle for a few minutes. We ordered 2 cups of peach jelly tea, 1 cup without sugar. When giving us water, the staff didn't tell us which glass was available and which one wasn't, so we had to try it to find out. At a HL restaurant in a large shopping mall, the service quality made me quite disappointed. Hope to receive an answer about this incident and also hope the brand shows a fix in the near future.
		- hoang nghia dang (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): The shop is spacious and beautifully designed

		- Âä†Ëó§ÈöºÂ§™ (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-06-28): It's quite strong compared to Japanese coffee, so even if you usually drink straight coffee, you might want to add milk or sugar. It's an expensive mall, but the prices are still reasonable.
		- nghia dang (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): The restaurant is large and always full

		- nu kieu (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): In the morning, I went to the cafe in the Highlands quite early. Ask the staff what time the restaurant opens. The guy wearing glasses is 1m70 tall and quite thin. He seemed uncomfortable and said 10 o'clock in a curt manner. I think a system like Highland needs a better way to train employees about the experience.
		- Vy Nguyen (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): The drinks here are too sweet, do not comply with customer requests about reducing the amount of sugar, and do not note information to distinguish between glasses of water.
		- Therapy Sport (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): good and fast good luck
		- ngan tran dai (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Too bad for the service, Drink a cup of coffee without a refreshing cup of iced tea. When you go to the service counter, they only sell filtered water
		- Lam Chau (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): A comfortable place to relax after stressful work hours
		- Glass Bead (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Large size milk coffee has a small amount of coffee and the drink is too sweet, the amount of coffee is also less than the size, mixed unevenly, probably the same with other drinks...
		- Ti·∫øn Vivu (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): The restaurant space is large
		- Xu√¢n Hoa (3.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Coffee prices at landmark81 branch are higher than other branches I've visited. Specifically, it's 45k for a cup of coffee size M (usually 39k). The important thing is that the brewed coffee is too sweet.
		- Nguy·ªÖn Trung Hi·∫øu (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): There is nothing that makes this branch special compared to other places where drinking water prices are more expensive. The guest's glass of water was still sitting but he quickly came to serve it as if he wanted to chase it away
		- Nguyen Van Thanh (3.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Crowded and noisy

		- Long L√™ Th√†nh (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): This is a premium coffee shop?? The staff had a terrible attitude, after delivering the goods, they took the pick-up card and threw it away, making faces or something??
		- Nhi Nguy·ªÖn (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Poor service staff, default drink sizes and not asking in advance, promotions exist without mentioning them so customers can use them, when asked, they answer with a dismissive attitude. Very dissatisfied, needs improvement!
		- Cong Thanh Nguyen (3.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Located in basement B1 of Landmark 81 building, there is Highlands restaurant to stop and chat about prices like other restaurants in the system.

reviews:
		- Andy Nguyen (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): I recently visited Nakajima Suisan at Landmark 81 and was genuinely impressed by both the quality and value of the food. I ordered the promo sushi set, which featured a delightful combination of shrimp, salmon, and squid for only VND 99,000. The sushi was incredibly fresh, with each piece well-prepared and flavorful. Despite being a budget-friendly option, the quality exceeded expectations, making it a fantastic deal.  Additionally, I tried the surimi king crab meat for just VND 59,000, and it was equally satisfying. The texture and flavor were spot on, proving that affordability doesn‚Äôt have to compromise taste or quality.  The overall experience was a pleasant surprise‚Äîgreat sushi at such reasonable prices in a prime location. Whether you‚Äôre a sushi lover or just looking for a light, fresh meal that doesn‚Äôt break the bank, Nakajima Suisan is worth checking out!
		- Th√†nh Ng√¥ (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-23): Absolutely satisfied with the food Grilled dishes are mesmerizingly delicious
		- Omega Alpha (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): The seafood was generally tasty with cost worth compared to that of Japan or South Korea
		- Michael Johnson (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-07-28): Shushi here delicious and cheap. Not only that, I also receive free mochi when I buy this shushi!ü•∞ü•∞
		- Alberto Montalesi (3.0‚≠ê, 2024-05-28): Having tried the one in Tamashimaya I was very excited when this place opened near home. We‚Äôve been getting takeout sushi since they opened and we were very satisfied with it until the last couple of times. Lately the rice has been dry and the fish was not as nice as before, with even a couple of bones found in the salmon.  I hope it was just a momentary misstep and the quality hasn‚Äôt really declined because it used to be my favorite sushi spot in town.
		- Quan Nguyen (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-07-28): Amazing service and sushi very fresh!!
		- Kathy Kharchenko (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): I spent almost 3 months in Japan, and this is the closest you can get to Japanese sushi in Vietnam. Please don‚Äôt adjust to local, keep being authentic.
		- Ph√°t Nguy·ªÖn (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Fresh fish. Reasonable price, suitable for tourists

		- Tuhuynh Huynhtu (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-24): Bought grilled fish during promotion so the price is cheap. Only 99k but the fish pieces are big, delicious flavor everyone.
		- WOO (2.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): The atmosphere of the store and the sushi seem to be well done in the Japanese style on the outside, but when I actually eat it, it smells fishy... Is the rice really sushi rice? I want to... I've never seen such a fishy smell from salmon in my life. I don't know if the male employee working at the counter is willing to work or not... I even said hello to him, but he didn't respond... Even if it was strange that the fish came in that day, please, let's hire good workers. Otherwise, it would be better to replace it with an unmanned machine and run it. Why are the other reviews so good?
		- Nguy·ªÖn Xu√¢n H·∫£i (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-24): The food is fresh and delicious, the staff is very friendly and cute.
		- sport thunder (3.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): The compact store has very reasonable seating arrangements despite the small space.

Adding pink ginger as a side dish is ok.

		- Shin Taka (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-04-28): I will add this as the situation is getting worse and worse.  Staff who can speak English only sometimes The rice was either too sticky or too hard, and tasteless. No price sticker attached Customer service is too bad I would like to have them check the chopsticks when I take them home or have them attached automatically!  This is from the perspective of a customer who uses the service continuously at about 3 million VND per month.  Below are ‚≠êÔ∏è3 from the previous post This time, I will change the rating to 1 star until I see an improvement.  Since it opened, I've been buying and eating at the restaurant about 3 times a week.  These days, take-out sushi is only available in expensive or large quantities, which is not good for one person.  I would like them to prepare more value products like other stores.

		- Tam Nguyen (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): Specialise for geese dishes, many options for drinking food, 8 out of 10 for the quality, get the great view of landmark 81 Just one minus point the staff was dishonest when we paid then they gave us change but only big money, small one they kept with the reason that they didn't have small change üôÑ, I could have given tip if they didn't do that

		- Nh√† ·ªü v√† Du L·ªãch (3.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): 3 star review ‚Äì Hang Ngan Street Pub  I visited the restaurant on the weekend with my friends. The general feeling is that the restaurant has a pretty good space, not too cramped but not really spacious either. Service staff is enthusiastic but sometimes slow due to the restaurant being crowded.  Regarding food, some dishes are quite delicious, especially grilled dishes and hot pots, but some dishes are not prepared evenly, some are a bit salty or oily. The price is okay compared to the general level, not too expensive but not really cheap either.  The minus point is that it takes quite a long time to prepare the dish, especially when the restaurant is crowded. Besides, the surrounding area is a bit noisy, making it difficult to have a comfortable conversation. Overall, this is a popular pub, suitable for gathering friends, but if you want to experience better service, you can consider other options.
		- IVy Nguyen (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): The other night, I visited Hang Ngan Street to find a place to have dinner that was both delicious and comfortable. The shop is located in a quite convenient location and the biggest plus is the view overlooking Landmark 81, especially in the evening, the view is also OK. But remember, going to Nguyen Huu Canh street at night will be quite congested.  Experience details: * Food: I ordered the main dish which is roasted goose with garlic, but I didn't find the unique taste. The food is presented quite attractively and the quantity is just enough for 2 people. The taste of the dish, in my opinion, is pleasant and suitable for general taste. However, a small minus point is that the goose meat is a bit dry. If it was cooked softer, it would be perfect. In addition, the restaurant also has many other dishes on the menu, with a variety of choices. * Service: Service staff is quick and enthusiastic. They are always on hand to support customers. The parking attendant was also very friendly and cheerful, creating a good impression right from the start. * Price: The price on Hang Ngan Street, in my opinion, is quite reasonable, suitable for the budget. With the number of dishes I ordered, the final bill was not too high. Because I ordered a bit more than I could eat, I had to pack a portion to take home. This also shows that the restaurant is quite generous with the amount of food. * Space: The restaurant space is quite airy and clean. View of Landmark 81 from the restaurant is a big plus, especially in the evening when the building lights up. However, because the restaurant is pub-style, there are quite a few staff standing around. This may make some diners feel a bit "overwhelmed"  In general, if you're looking for a budget friendly option, if you've tried the bong, I think it's okay to come here.
		- Dinh Hieu Nguyen (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-07): Delicious food, reasonable prices, many dishes to choose from, fast service, I think it's too fast because when you order, you bring all the dishes up so the food can easily get cold. View of landmark is close and beautiful. Suggested goose leg salad eaten with roasted goose with garlic will make it less boring.
		- C∆∞·ªùng Tr∆∞∆°ng C√¥ng (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): The restaurant has a beautiful view and very reasonable prices. Garlic-burned Ngan dish is not dry and tastes very good. The tofu dish with onion fat is outstanding, the skin is crispy and the tofu core is soft. Will come back to try more dishes
		- Nguyen Tan Van (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-25): The duck dishes are quite delicious and the atmosphere is very chill. The owner is friendly and hospitable.
		- Khanh Tr·∫ßn (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): Location near landmark. Easy to find. Open space. There is a place to park motorbikes. Food: delicious Northern dishes such as roasted goose with garlic, grilled fish skewers, and blood shoot soup. Reasonable price. Service: dishes quickly. Enthusiastic staff
		- Thy Sam Anh (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): The frog is delicious, so I recommend coming here to eat Delicious mixed dish Ngoc said that anyone who can eat it should try it The roasted garlic is very fragrant
		- Tri Tran Minh (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Following the reviews of some Tiktokers & Vlogers about a restaurant specializing in Hanoi goose dishes. First impression is that it's very crowded due to going on the weekend. Although it has just opened, there are still many updates, but basically it is quite good. Cute and enthusiastic staff The quality of the dishes is generally very good, especially the dishes specializing in goose. Besides, some side dishes are not good. Hopefully the shop will adjust again after the initial period.
		- Nghia Luu (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-10-28): Delicious goose, reasonable price, beautiful landmark view, very suitable for a fun chill evening
		- Ho√†ng Linh Ng√¥ (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): Delicious food, quick service. The service staff is enthusiastic and delicious.
		- Huy T√¥ Nh·ª±t (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): Delicious food, reasonable prices, billions of drinking views :), the owner is cute, handsome, when he smiles it makes him want to pack his things to take with him haha, naturally I'm in love with Hanoi haha
		- Thu·ª≥ Trang Ph·∫°m V∆∞∆°ng (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-05-28): - The Hanoi dishes here are very delicious, seasoned to taste, and the price is also affordable compared to the quality. Having pickled bamboo shoots to eat with them is delicious. - The staff is extremely cute, agile, and attentive - Cool open space with extremely chill 81 view, ideal place to gather friends and family
		- Th√†nh ƒê√†o (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-04-28): Hang Ngan Street - Enjoy Hanoi specialties in the heart of Saigon  My husband and I recently had the opportunity to experience Pho Hang Ngan restaurant in District 2, with Hanoi specialties. The restaurant has a spacious, airy space, simple design, feels like being in Hanoi's old quarter.  I ordered 3 dishes and was extremely surprised because each dish was very filling and richly cooked.  - Charred garlic goose: This dish is marinated with rich spices, then fried to a crispy texture. The goose meat is soft, sweet, mixed with a strong garlic flavor, served with raw vegetables and sweet and sour dipping sauce for a wonderful flavor. - Braised goose with alligator: The sour taste of alligator mixed with the fatty taste of goose meat creates a unique flavor, stimulating the taste buds. Braised duck with crocodile is served with vermicelli and raw vegetables. - La Vong fish cake: Fragrant grilled fish cake, served with vermicelli, herbs, roasted peanuts and shrimp paste mixed with lemon and chili.  - Price: Reasonable - Service: Fast, enthusiastic - Space: Spacious, airy, clean - The restaurant has spacious parking.
		- Tony Nguyen (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): The first time I went to breakfast here, the service was very bad. I kept ordering and got the wrong dish, and the food was not very decent. Recently when I went out for dinner, the service was completely different. They advised me on what to order, the food came out very quickly, the food was delicious, I smiled happily, asked if the food was delicious. The space has been transformed from a restaurant into a pub, so it's fun but a bit noisy and bustling. The price is quite ok compared to the local area, the quality is good.
		- Khanh Nguyen (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): The restaurant has a view of Landmark81, sitting outside is cool. Ngan is quite suitable, the service staff is enthusiastic, it's crowded so it's a bit slow.  The only minus point is that the drinking cup is not washed clean so there is still grease left on it üòÖüòÖ
		- Thanh Thanh (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-05-28): Beautiful view, airy, delicious food. There is a taste of Hanoi in the dish, making me miss Hanoi again
		- Congkha Bui (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-05-28): The restaurant is airy, delicious food, suitable for eating with friends and family, good service, good music, I will definitely come back to the restaurant when I return to Ho Chi Minh City.
		- Nghi Ph∆∞∆°ng (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): Delicious food, lovely staff
		- Vi Th·∫£o (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): The goose is soft and chewy, the goose is charred with garlic and is not dry on the inside. Next time, if possible, I'll ask first if there's anyone who can't eat onions. I'm just giving my opinion because my friend can't eat onions, but we still think it's ok. Delicious 10 points
		- Angelina Nguyen (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-10-28): The food is diverse, suitable for both drinkers and eaters. There is a view of the Landmark building. The price is stable - if I go with 4 people to eat full, the bill is about more than 200k/person. However, the day I went, I don't know if it was a mistake from the waiter or the kitchen. I ordered once while the restaurant was still empty, but after more than half an hour, I still didn't have enough dishes, even though my table reminded me 2-3 times. Minus 1 star.
		- C K (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-08-28): The staff are kind, and the store has a great atmosphere with a local feel. There was a clerk who could speak Japanese! The food was delicious too!
		- Trang Pham (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-08-28): Delicious, lots of food, super enthusiastic staff, and fast food preparation
		- Lynn Le (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): The restaurant serves quite quickly. Taste of Hanoi, goose salad is delicious and pleasant. The goose noodle soup is a bit salty. Delicious bamboo shoots.
		- Th·ªßy Ph·∫°m (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-04-28): The food came up quickly but seemed pre-made because it wasn't hot like bamboo shoot soup The blood is also a bit stiff Garlic roasted goose that hasn't finished yet is not very similar to eating it outside in Hanoi  I ordered a small portion for 2 people The restaurant staff is enthusiastic from the time they park the car to the time they order the food

		- Nam Tr·∫ßn (3.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Good service, good food but the price is not up to Vin's neighbors' standards.
		- Tran Pham (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-08-28): Ngan's food is delicious, it's ok to go in large groups, it's a bit much for 2 people.
		- Denis Deken (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): Wait too long, dish ordered forgotten, they make it again 30 minutes later and forget it again and ask me to wait another 10 minutes. And the dish is re-charged once again
		- Lucien Richard (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): Waiting too long when there were few customers, and the boss opens the napkins saying it's free and charges at the end! I do not advise

		- L√¢m Ph·∫°m Ph√∫ (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-10-28): Sit and eat while looking at the super beautiful 81-story building Diverse menu, suitable dishes for gathering to eat and drink
		- Ng∆∞·ªùi b√≠ ·∫©n (2.0‚≠ê, 2024-08-28): I visited the restaurant for the second time but probably won't have another time!!! The first time I came to try it, the second time I came because there were some cute and enthusiastic staff. This second time I had an experience where I have to use the word *Bad*, the staff service was very ok, but the food and atmosphere were very, very bad. Burned garlic got blood on it, the music was playing karaoke so loudly that I couldn't even eat in peace!!! There was a guy claiming to be the shop manager who came over to hook up with his lover. I was annoyed but she kept talking and said that when she left, I heard my lover tell me that she was drunk and said some unnecessary things!! I really don't like this. Hopefully the restaurant should work again on the food and management so that customers can trust and come back to support!

		- Dieu Nguyen Thi (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-06-28): The dishes are all good, just okay. A huge plus point is that the food is not sweet Service style is very good and fast. The space of the restaurant is simple, with air conditioning. I quite like it here
		- LE NGOC MINH NGUYEN (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-07-28): Came here to try the roasted goose with garlic, but what scored points for me was the stir-fried tripe with luffa, goose salad, and bamboo shoot soup. Delicious and moderate, worth a try. For me, the roasted garlic goose has a strong five-spice flavor, and the goose meat is a bit hard and salty. But overall the meal was good!
		- Trong Quy Phan (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): The view of Landmark 81, eating and enjoying a glass of beer is amazing

reviews:
		- Adamo Bergola (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): If you‚Äôre here because you booked or are going to book on booking.com please cancel as it is a major scam. These apartments are not permitted to rent short term. Please look up the landmark 81 scam for further details and reviews. Booking.com should be at fault for allowing all this to happen through their website. Key was deactivated after checking in. They are doing this with many properties in the area. The room we booked was not where we were brought too. The address on the booking did not match the unit. Please beware as we were among many people in that lobby going through the same issue. We packed up and left as it was all very suspicious.  We were refused our refund to top it all off.
		- Maria (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): We booked a nice cozy studio there (according to pictures we saw on hotels.com), but when we arrived they were trying to scam us by giving rooms that were completely different, looked cheaper, older, not well-kept and with black mold. After three attempts of scam we finally got something similar looking with what we booked, but still not the same as in pictures. It seemed they had only one housekeeper for the whole building so the cleaning service was bad and we found some stuff under our bed, such as dirty underwear, dust and other trash. The front desk staff were not friendly at all. We do not recommend this place.
		- jakob (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Landmark 81 residences luxury apartment is a scam on both agoda and booking.com you can read in so many reviews that this place is a  SCAM!!!! It is ILLEGAL to rent short term. So any booking you make you most likely will be robbed if you pay in advance. This a typical scam for this building. The owner of the property will confirm your booking but on arrival they will pick up when you call them but immediately hang up!
		- Abraham Setiawan (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): Booked the place a long time ago via booking.com and got confirmation. And then when we were queueing for airport immigration, they told us that the rooms are sold out and they have no intention of honoring the confirmed booking. ‚ÄúSorry, hope you understand‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make it any better. It was very stressful to book a new hotel last minute.  AVOID AT ALL COST!!
		- Herbal Palace (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): Booked a room paid for it online. Let them know my check in time. No one answer. Not a clean place. They just pick up and hang up. Not good business. Will never be back.
		- √ömi Vera (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): Not worth staying here. Price too high and there are way better high rises in the city, with better amenities and far more affordable prices. Avoid making this mistake. The rentals here are a scam honestly
		- HeeOn Huynh (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): The very modern apartment buildings have spacious, natural surroundings. The fireworks show on the lunar new year was fantastic.
		- Stephen Baines (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-06-28): A heads up! Apartment 9014 on the 14th floor is not worth the money to stay there. The female owner cannot speak English, which was very frustrating when trying to convince her that only 2 vents out of 6 actually had air coming through them to cool an apartment 85m !!ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  My partner and I went to use the pool on the 4th floor but were met by a closed glass door with nobody in sight. We tried knocking on the door and speaking to others nearby but nobody could help us. After asking the owner why we couldn‚Äôt use the pool area she informed us it uses fingerprint technology to get in! This information was never given to us when we were shown to our room and had I not asked we would be none the wiser!  The owner thought our issues were funny and I asked why she was smiling but she just shook her head and walked away.  The lifts are maze in Tower 81 as is trying to get in and out of the complex due to everything being operated by swipe cards or fingerprint technology.  I booked for 6 nights and stayed less than 2 hours due to poor service from the owner  DO NOT STAY IN THIS APARTMENT!
		- Truong Phan (2.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): It is too far from the city and the accommodation is not cheap. The aircond were broken in some lift and along the corridor in our level 14 which caused the smell in the rubbish room spread along the corridor. Everything is expensive in the Vincom Center which is adjacent to the apartment where the main escalator has a wear conveyor belt.
		- tommy cha (3.0‚≠ê, 2024-08-28): The outside is 5 star , the inside is a 3 star , it‚Äôs an old building now compare to other high rises , some rooms has cockroach , and it‚Äôs not clean as you would expect from the outside view, the location is amazing since the lower level is connected to a huge mall that consist of everything you need from supermarkets , a lot of restaurants, movie theaters and more
		- gima ganhui (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Please noted that there is an accommodation in landmark 81 apartment, the environment is very poor, the photos do not match the photos on agoda's official website, and the smell of the room is very bad, the landlord will not respond immediately, and we won't recommend this place again.
		- Adrian Popescu (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Landmark 81 skyview it's the highest view point, located in the highest building in Vietnam and it's a Must Do experience in Saigon! I paid 300.000vnd for entrance and it worth every penny!

		- Th·∫£o V√¢n Mai Th·ªã (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-08-28): The rent for a 4-bedroom apartment is 5,000 USD, nice view. Service fees are very high. Staff are not enthusiastic when helping tenants, do not accept items for Shopee, and have an unfriendly attitude. Compared to the services of other cheaper apartments, they are still far behind while the service fees are high. On the 39th floor, many birds and bugs flew in, and the broken glass took forever to fix.
		- –ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –®–µ–¥–µ–≤–∏ (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Landmark 81 Residences Luxury Apartment They cheat with the reservation. They just don‚Äôt settle in and ignore them. When they call they hang up. Be careful We are currently in correspondence with booking. So that they would solve the issue. We haven't gotten around to it yet.
		- Linh Kona Life (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-04-28): A place you should stay and experience even once. Love the park and swimming pool here
		- H·ªìng B·∫£o Khuy√™n (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Annam Gourmet has diverse and rich goods. The general price is a bit higher than some other supermarkets, but the price is still acceptable. Most probably are alcoholic drinks üòÖ At the supermarket, the Nespresso counter has a program to try 1 of 5 types of coffee for free. I ordered sponge coffee. Delicious, fragrant, fatty, slightly sour taste. I get drunk easily on caffeine, but I don't get drunk when drinking this. Nespresso's program applies until December 21, 2022, coffee fans should try it üòâ

		- Qu√Ω Nh√¢n V≈© (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-09-28): The most luxurious apartment in Vietnam, very good service. Cool surroundings and all amenities from healthcare to schools and supermarkets. It's great to experience life here.
		- Vy Y√™n (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-06-28): The apartment is okay, poor soundproofing.  Customer service is extremely bad. Employees push their responsibilities and waste customers' time.
		- Thanh T√πng Nguy·ªÖn (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): It's raining so much, the staff ignores me because I'm poor and doesn't say anything, but they still have a rustic attitude and they always receive elegantly dressed guests, and there's an eye-catching ice skating area.
		- Jimmy Nguy·ªÖn (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): The park has a very large lawn, suitable for families to picnic. The open harbor is very airy...

		- Thuy Huynh (3.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): I had dinner today with my family. Our server was very pushy and try to up sales I did not like that. I feel very uncomfortable if I really want I would‚Äôve asked for recommendation. For the quality of the food I didn‚Äôt think the price was bad. The roasted pork was my favorite . Over all all of the other servers and their customer service was great.
		- ngan Ninh (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-08-28): I had a great night here with my family. It was a luxurious and comfortable dining experience. All the traditional Chinese food is absolutely amazing
		- Willi Wang (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-08-28): Favorite Chinese restaurant in Saigon. Food, service, presentation and management here is top üëå
		- T Thanh (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): Another interesting place for those who love quintessential Hong Kong-style cuisine: Yu Pin Xuan Restaurant on the 4th floor - Landmark 81  Previously this place was Peach Garden restaurant, but the food was not so WOW, now it has changed to Yu Pin Xuan with a lot of innovation in the food, perhaps a new chef.  - Peking duck is very delicious, especially the pia cake is very different: thin and lightly grilled, not steamed like most other restaurants. So when eaten, it is very harmonious and pleasant. Scored 9/10. - The appetizer of tomatoes soaked in soy sauce is truly wow, with cold fresh tomatoes, soaked in soy sauce. I'm someone who doesn't like eating raw tomatoes, but I'm still very impressed with this taste creation. - Crab steamed with pepper wine is very special. You can ask the restaurant to remove it if the meal is not convenient to use by hand. - Steamed fish with homemade tofu layer is very special. - Fried rice with truffle mushrooms is very delicious.  - Other items, I will review in each picture.
		- Ng·ªçc √Ånh L√™ Nguy·ªÖn (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): The staff brings out "play food" for customers while waiting for the main dish without clearly stating whether there is a charge or not? Personally, I think the restaurant brings this dish to sip while waiting for the main dish. When it came time to pay, I was charged 3 dishes (cucumber + pickles (a few pieces) + thin fried cake, a few slices but total 60k). Not worth much money but feels like being cheated, it would be better for the staff to tell the customer clearly from the beginning to know. I really hate this kind of service!  As for the food, I ordered it - Sweet and sour ribs => Ribs have very little meat, eating them feels like chewing crispy fried dough with sauce so the price is not suitable for the dish! - Char Siu noodles with water => eat normally
		- Gavin Lin (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-09-28): Except for fish and crabs, which are priced at market prices, the prices of other meals are reasonable for such an environment, and all the dishes ordered are delicious.
		- L√™ V≈© Ng·ªçc Thanh - Khoa K·∫ø to√°n (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-09-28): Delicious food, beautiful presentation, luxurious space, right at Landmark 81 building, surprising with the price (reasonable price, not expensive).
		- Mia Thai (Mia Thai) (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-06-28): High-class Chinese restaurant, cozy space. The food is beautifully decorated, and there is a private room suitable for entertaining customers and hosting parties for families and companies.
		- Tung Pham (2.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-23): The restaurant is expensive but the waiter is unhygienic, sneezed into his hand 3 times but refused to wash his hands
		- Linh Pham Phuong (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-05-28): Delicious food. I ate some dishes like roast duck (half duck), mushroom soup, and porridge, all of which were delicious. When I went to eat, it wasn't very crowded, probably because it's quite hidden (on the 4th floor of Landmark81). But it's delicious. All the customers are Chinese, and the staff can also speak Chinese and Cantonese
		- Dung Tr·∫ßn (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-04-28): True to Chinese restaurant standards, if you have a large round table for a family or a group of friends with more than 10 people, it's still ok!
		- Thu Hien Do (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-04-28): These dim sum are okay, but the price is okay with the quality
		- P Lucky (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-06-28): Very good Delicious Xiao Long Bao Peking duck wrapped for you impressed
		- Bich Ha Khieu (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-04-28): Plus points are polite and attentive service, luxurious space, delicious food, suitable for lunch - dinner with partners.
		- Thi√™n Hu·ª≥nh (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-05-28): The food and decoration are excellent
		- Lyna P (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-04-28): I went to eat on a weekday so it wasn't too crowded, there were tables to eat in. While walking that day, I was craving Chinese food and saw that Landmarks had it but had never eaten it before, so my friend and I stopped in to try it. Try it and you'll be surprised by its deliciousness. However, the air-conditioned place where I sat was a bit too cold. Besides, it's 10d, I'm worried about forgetting to take pictures
		- Thoa Nguyen (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-04-28): Luxurious restaurant, 5-star service. The price is worth the quality. Will definitely come back again. Suggestion: taking Grab, stopping in front of the entrance to the shopping mall and going up the elevator is the most convenient. If you take the car parked in the basement, it's a bit difficult to find the way up.
		- Ung Luu (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): The restaurant is beautiful, the food is delicious and the dishes I ordered were all decorated with beautiful patterns. Especially the cherry tomato dish is very cute.

reviews:
		- Nel C (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): Set underneath Landmark 81. Taxis at the front and back. B1 plenty of food and a central food court. I ate in several of these places. The ramen place is excellent. DIMai and Coco Ichibanya are also excellent. Large Vinmart on B1 too. There are 3 floors of shops, some are high end. I bought eye glasses here too. Ownways, excellent. I like this mall, there are less people. Not like Vincom mall in Dist1 or Takashimaya, which are packed. 5*
		- Ken Wong (3.0‚≠ê, 2024-07-28): Vincom Center Landmark 81 is a new shopping center with potential but currently offers a limited number of shops. Prices are slightly above average, which may not appeal to all visitors. Additionally, the lack of English signage makes navigation challenging for non-Vietnamese speakers. While it shows promise, improvements in shop variety and more comprehensive signage would enhance the overall shopping experience. As it stands, Vincom Center Landmark 81 is a work in progress that needs refinement to fully meet the expectations of international shoppers.
		- Ally M (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): The staff of the mall use the baby changing facilities to play video games, whilst paying guests have to wait 20 minutes to change their baby. Will never return here again
		- Joey Kwan (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Lack of information. No information desk. Directions screen lack of information. You have to go all over place to finding where you need to go. Asking some employees they just told you down stair and no more information to provide. This is the most famous landmark in Vietnam but the parking doesn‚Äôt have exit or way out signs. You have drive around in parking lot to find your own way to get out the building as in the maze. The only we saw were right at the exit which post in front of cars parking rows and you won‚Äôt able to see it directly. The worst design and worst management of the world.
		- Nikhil Rao (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): Small but good collection of shops, restaurants and a nice ice rink with very reasonable prices.  Food court has varied choices across Japanese, Korean, Malaysian and of course Vietnamese cuisine. Good place for quick eating options and a drink  Easy access from any landmark buildings and includes a win mart for daily necessity
		- WhatJessLove ! (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-05-28): Branded shopping centre.. There are 2 supermarkets and an ice rink, cgv cinema, food court and restaurants, coffee shops, home appliances, facial wash and many more.. üëçüèª ‚Ä¶
		- Q Nguyen (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-06-28): this mall has a lot to offer. lots of imported goods from different countries. i‚Äôm only giving it 4 stars because there‚Äôs a lot of stores that aren‚Äôt new or special to me since i see them at every mall where im from. i did like that there were a few stores that were somewhat exclusive to asia like miniso/minigood, innisfree and a few others (those were just the ones i really liked). the mall is more of a ‚Äúluxury‚Äù mall so expect to see higher price points than at other places. food is more expensive here too and a lot of places charge you for a bag to carry your stuff in after purchasing

		- Sang Nguy·ªÖn (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): Vincom Shopping Center is located in landmark building 81, the tallest building in Ho Chi Minh City. If you want to visit, you can combine the Waterbus from Bach Dang to Binh An pier and then take a taxi to visit, which is quite convenient.  If you have small children, you can go down to the B1 floor where there is Tiniworld and games for children. In addition, the B1 floor has many restaurants, cinemas, and ice skating areas for you to eat and drink. My family stopped by to eat at Hue Delight restaurant, the food was quite delicious and the price was quite good.  The upper floors are shopping and coffee areas. If you want a place to sit and enjoy the view, you can go to the 3rd floor where there is Phuc Long cafe and next to it is a Japanese tea shop with a quite chill design.

When many groups of guests begged to open the door and said the car and family members were waiting outside, they replied: "I told them to go home, who told everyone not to leave?" even though they had not reminded the guests before. Guarding the Dior gate, extremely bad and insolent attitude, not even bothering to guide guests to another exit. While the guest groups all include children and the elderly. Security guards only focus on following the correct process and taking photos to report their work without paying attention to the level of customer satisfaction. Never come back again

If you request past 12 o'clock, you will be charged an overnight fee of 120k. TOO UNREASONABLE for customers, moreover customers use electric vehicles. I am a customer coming to use the service. If the movie is shown late, you should go see it until 12 o'clock until it ends. If it comes out then, then when will it be? There is nowhere to park on the ground. It would be good for CGV to work again with the building

reviews:
		- JayaSankar S (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-08-28): Super nice big screen, IMAx cinema, also CGV IMAX This place is quite very beautiful. Nice can visit this place family friends, even kids. also high recommended this place. 81 landmark inside of the building. The big screen watching movie, you feel satisfied to watch this place, I loveit. Thank you for your service for people üôèüòä
		- Khanh Nguyen (Theodore) (3.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): A big cinema on B1 of Vincom Landmark 81 ü•≥ very big hall and lots of waiting seats. Quite spacious for guests to take photos and feel comfortable. This cinema has the biggest IMAX auditorium in Vietnam, the price is also the same for 2D showtime üëåüèª  After the pandemic, I can say that CGV is losing its quality, cutting down so many priviledges and also no many staffs during peak hours. That also explains why we are having so many long queu in the hallway üòä  Talking about quality, no other local cinemas can offer the same quality as CGV because they invest a lot of money to built their screen and seats, so the experience is always so different from other competitors. Once you are at CGV, you will never want to leave the brand for others ü§óü§óü§ó  But I have to admit that I am still very disatisfied with this gowngrade in service recently ü•π
		- David Bui (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): I had a disappointing experience at CGV Landmark 81. I purchased tickets for a 10:30 PM showing of Gladiator, but realized I wouldn't make it due to the late finish time of 1:30 AM. I arrived at the theatre by 10:15 PM hoping to exchange my tickets for the following night, but was told they couldn't assist me because their policy requires at least 45 minutes' notice before the show starts. This is a frustrating and inflexible rule, especially when situations change last minute. I expected better customer service from a major cinema chain.
		- Vincent Bahk (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Good location. This is on basement in v8ncom land mark81.  This has a hige IMAX theater but price is not over7-8$.  And there are many restaurants and coffee shops near theater.  If you have to wait for some one or movie time,  These will be very good option.
		- Tu Anh Tran (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Very nice cinema which located in Landmark 81, the tallest building in Ho Chi Minh City. The equipment here are new and modern, the seats are comfortable. The Imax cinema is huge and good place to see the blockbuster movies
		- Andrew Pantyukhin (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): good IMAX hall, probably the best in Vietnam at this time; most seats are comfortable to watch a movie in terms of angle and distance; enjoyed Dune 2 here
		- Nhat Anh Hoang (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Went to watch avatar 2, nice waiting room, a bit crowded but enormous imax room. You should watch imax when available!
		- Sky (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Had been to quite a few CGV cinemas in HCM. This one is probably the best due to its location inside basement 1 of Vincom Centre of Landmark 81. You don‚Äôt have to worry where to eat as there are many restaurants around and the cinema is huge , similar to those in Singapore .
		- Anh Ng (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Nice experience at Golden class. But F&B options could be better.
		- Sam (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-06-28): Gold class here is a very good experience, as the reclining seats are together with tables either side. This is the equivalent of a big reclining sofa for both of you. Gold class screen is much bigger than others in the area. I would say that Imax was just OK though, chairs are uncomfortable especially for long movies, although screen is a good size.
		- Unix Nguyen (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): We had to watch a 30 mins add and the movie stopped and restarted multiple times
		- Lasitha Ranaweera (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): I have visited multiple times to see movies on Normal and IMax both. Normal viewing would start from 120KVND and Imax is about 180K. Popcorn and drinks are on the higher side compared to other locations but the pop corn is very nice and quantity is also good.  Seats are clean and even the people coming to see the movies tends to keep their surroundings clean after the show is completed.  Its normal to have about 10-15 mins on Advertisements before the show and if you are late by few mins... don't need to worry about it. If  you are staying close to the theater in the Vinhome Central then you can just walk in with the ticket when the show is started or just before it. First time i went... i walked in 10mins early and i was literally the only person inside. Once the show began... people started walking in.  Enjoy and have a great experience
		- Tim Chihuahua (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-06-28): A so so cinema with old style seats compared to western standards. Large screen label as 3D max. Probably one of the best in Vietnam.
		- Waqqas Hanafi (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-06-28): Lie-MAX and lack of salted popcorn available has forced me to dock a star. Otherwise it was clean and accessible, without long lines and English speaking staff.
		- Logic Topic (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): Motorbike parking is a nightmare at night üòÖ but worth experiencing it. ‚Ä¶
		- Duy Thuan Nguyen (3.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Late checkout has no elevator/stair to escape
		- T√†i L√™ (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-14): Good
		- Huong Dang (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Disrespectful staff i have ever seen. I bought tickets for our cousins, and the guy who check our tickets not allow one of us to check in bc he was underage (the fact that he‚Äôs 12+). Bad experience with CGV for the third times! I‚Äôll never come back here. So freaking badd
		- Milind Zemse (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Nice place to watch movie. Picture and sound quality is execellent.  The only thing is Air Condition was poor. I hope they should chill the AC little more.  Aside from that, the sweetbox should have little more recline to relax the back throughout the movie.  Thanks
		- William L NG (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Goooooood , or best in term of Cinemas techs as well as investment.. but the Land mark 81 building and shopping center it's  self....not even meeting standard of ..3 stars
		- Jeramie Kramer (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): They won't let a 13 year old go to a movie  with parents because it is rated T16. They  think they know better than parents. Worst customer service and need to allow parents to make a choice.
		- Mai Th·∫£o (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): We come to CGV paying premium price to watch commercial ads that CGV got paid to show? This is outrageous. We have to spend 15 minutes watching ads before the movie. It's unacceptable. We pay much less for Spotify or Netflix for ad-free entertainment. This has to be stopped. #Adfreecinema.
		- Karl Nystrom (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): One of the nicest places in Asia. Cheap to go around. Recomended trip. I have been 3 times 2023 to Vietnam and HCM
		- Sinead Holohan (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): We went to the Avengers movie and was told that they were not serving salty popcorn as they were too busy. This is at 10:40am in the morning. They knew that they were going to be busy, but failed to prepare properly for the needs of their customers. Very disappointed with their service.
		- Anhtoan Nguyen (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): The IMAX experience is under par. didn't expect 70mm however did expect man IMAX digital experience. The screen coloring needs to be calibrated as it never gets close to dark and always has a tint of blue that is off..
		- Vu Nguyen (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Came here for Joker movie in gold class room. Excellent leather reclining armchair and free beverages. Service was 5 star. Screen and audience quality were 5 star.
		- Tri Nguyen (2.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Bathrooms flooded in the basement during high tide or when it rains. No pedestrian exits except to walk up the vehicle ramp after leaving a movie after 10pm.
		- Victor Danau (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Happy to be back in a movie theater! However it wasn't the CGV service we remember. Aircon was off in the lobby, very hot. Disorganized lines for popcorn. Nobody at the gold class entrance to check tickets.
		- DINESH KRISH (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): It has Imax screens . Just came to watch Vietnamese horror flim. Its located inside the tallest building of Ho chi Mim city. Its inB1 level

		- Ngoc Maggie (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Good place to watch movies.
		- Mr Hong (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): I'd love to use this theater's golden class. There are only few seats . so we can enjoy watching movies with quiet environments.
		- malko linge (3.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): In Gold class the chairs are comfortable,  they have complementary water or coffee but only a small glass, it's so cold inside so they give you fleece blankets ...but they are not so clean  ..and of course for TV the price of the ticket it's rather expensive.
		- Oscar L. (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Horrible, the most expensive cinema in saigon, but worse, 20 minutes of ads! The chair is uncomfortable too. Better stick to galaxy.
		- Kian Nguyen (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): good

		- jim Man (3.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Superb quality but they let little kids in C13 movie, also no staff at checkpoints.
		- Jackie Ph·∫°m T∆∞·ªùng Huy (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Love this place with many choices of Imax, 4DX, Gold Class, Premium & normal rooms!!! Staff is awesome!

		- Nguyen Luong Hung (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): Located on Floor B1 of Vincom Landmark81, CGV is very convenient for watching movies. CGV is very spacious and airy. Nice cinema room. CJ CGV  belongs to the CJ Group, a multinational cinema chain of Korea. In addition to the domestic market, CGV also has branches in China, Indonesia, Myanmar, T√ºrkiye and Vietnam. It is the 5th largest cinema chain worldwide, currently operating 3,412 theaters in 455 locations in 7 different countries. Of which 1,111 theaters are in 149 different localities of Korea. CGV is abbreviated from the three initial letters of the words: Cultural (culture), Great (great) and Vital (essential for life). I love CGV ‚ù§‚ù§üòçüòçüåπüåπüé∂üé∂
		- Toon Tran (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): CGV Vincom Center Landmark 81, located on the B1 floor of Vincom Landmark 81, is one of the most advanced and modern cinema complexes in Ho Chi Minh City. With a prime location in the city's iconic building, the theater is always crowded and bustling, especially during peak hours or weekends.  The screening room here is very beautiful, with a large screen and vivid sound system, providing the ultimate cinematic experience. The seats are soft, comfortable, and reasonably arranged to ensure every viewing angle is good. VIP or Gold Class screening rooms are also a great choice if you want to experience a more private and luxurious space.  Staff at CGV Landmark 81 are very friendly, always ready to support and serve customers quickly despite the large number of customers. The ticket and beverage purchasing area is also neatly organized. Even though it is crowded, it does not make you feel cramped or uncomfortable.  Although the ticket price here is slightly higher than other CGV theaters, it is completely worth the quality of service and luxurious space you receive. This is the ideal place for you to enjoy a movie in the most modern space.  If you are looking for a classy cinema experience right in the heart of Ho Chi Minh City, CGV Vincom Center Landmark 81 is definitely an option not to be missed! üé•üçø
		- L√ä H√ôNG V·ª∏ (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-10-28): The theater is large, the seats are quite OK, because it's in a famous building so there are quite a few people watching, the staff is cheerful and enthusiastic, and the toilets are clean. Because parking in the building's basement is quite far and some buildings may be full, it is recommended that if you watch here, you should go 15 minutes early to find a suitable parking space because you still have to travel to the theater if you come. If you're close to time, you'll easily be late for showtime.
		- NH√ÇN NGUY·ªÑN HO√ÄNG (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-07): On February 28, when I saw interstellar at the theater, I suddenly remembered that I didn't bring my wallet because it had fallen back on my seat in the theater. After 5 minutes when I returned, the theater had a new screening so I couldn't go in and find it again. Thanks to the employee (apparently the manager, she was wearing a black CGV shirt) she quickly ran back into the theater and found her wallet, there were a lot of important documents and some cash, luckily she didn't lose even 1 dong. I would like to sincerely thank the cgv staff for their full support. If you can read this comment, please thank me very much.
		- Thu Tr√¢m Tr·ªãnh Th·ªã (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-08-28): The theater is crowded and quite bustling, the staff is friendly. The screening room is quite nice, with lively sound and comfortable seats. I went to see Conan, right when there was an event to introduce the movie about Blackpink's concert, the Blinks gathered here and danced very enthusiastically.
		- Ng√¥ Xu√¢n Ng·ªçc Eriken (Eriken) (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): To see Captain America, the imax room is spacious and the sound is ok. Remember to go down to the B1 floor
		- Ho√†ng Phi Tr·∫ßn (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-07-28): Have been coming to experience CGV Landmark since 2020 and have been loyal until now, from the theater staff to everything that must be called neat. The staff are very friendly and cute. When meeting customers, they always greet and smile. I like the distance from the screen to the seat, because I like watching big screens, especially giant imax theaters. My favorite drink is sweet and sour mango peach sjora. Anyone who doesn't like carbonated drinks can choose this. Popcorn here is always hot. 100/10 ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
		- Kim Kim (2.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): You should review the subdivision, it's located next door in Vinhomes so you can check it out from time to time. The previous times I bought tickets, I bought them at the ticket counter. At 1:00 p.m., the ticket counter was countered, and the staff was at the water counter. Before that, another customer bought the ticket, but the staff just went to the ticket counter, so I went there to line up. Then at the counter I asked to check my ticket online, so I thought I'd buy it directly so I didn't have to wait. After the previous customer finished buying, the staff went over to the drink counter and continued to work, so confused :)) by looking at it, I knew it was because the theater's structure was not properly distributed. When I saw customers lining up behind me, I had to tell them. Sharing the counter If you spend the ticket at the water counter then combine it into one ticket, it's already expensive!!!! Reviewing is just for fun, I don't know if you'll read it!!!
		- esti maybe (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-08-28): I went to see BPWT the other day and was super surprised because the actors were very enthusiastic and quick. From the outside space to the inside theater, everything is very neat
		- Nhu Ngoc (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Watching Tu's winning billion-dollar kiss movie is very fun. This Cgv theater is beautiful and the staff is also very supportive but it's a bit far from where I live. If I have a chance, I will continue to support rap üòçüòçüëèüëè ‚Ä¶
		- Xuan Ngo (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-08-28): I ordered Gold Class to try it and I love it. The staff is super attentive and always serves their best. The chairs are also comfortable and the blanket service is also clean. There's no need to press the bell to call the staff. Bringing it in is truly classy. The experience of being served in person is worth every penny.
		- Thanh Tr√∫c (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): I went to buy a combo that clearly stated 1 corn, 2 drinks. The staff told me I would receive a free bag of burnt rice. I thought it was a free gift until I looked at the bill to see that it was intentionally selling another combo that was more expensive but introduced it to customers as a free gift. Moreover, there is also the practice of asking for change. I bought a glass of water for 39k, gave it 40k, and the staff stood there begging (really begging continuously) for me to give 1k because I had no change. Because at that time the staff opened the cash drawer, I could clearly see that there was still change inside. Why didn't I ask the customer if he had more money so he could conveniently change it instead of asking instead? I got hurt many times, not just once.
		- T√≠n Ph·∫°m (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): At the beginning of the year, I took the kids to see cartoons, set a schedule for 8:30 p.m., and the movie didn't show until 8:51 p.m. I wonder if CGV thinks the movie is for children to watch and then do whatever they want, without the concept of time? We spend money to go to the theater to watch a movie, bringing a relaxing moment on the first day of the year, not to spend money to go to the theater to spend more than 20 minutes watching commercials, bringing extreme discomfort, and confusion and anticipation to our customers. Children don't know when they will be able to watch movies.
		- my vo (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): The corn and juice consultation was not clear, the consultant stammered and did not clearly state the corn and juice combo with a bear lid for more than 500k for 2 cups. The customer asked again when he didn't hear the advice clearly and still didn't respond and continued to stutter. When it was time to pay, I broke 2 glasses with lids and 3 tickets for a total of more than 600k.
		- VƒÉn H√πng Vi (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): Employees don't know if they will receive training or anything. Hum, I bought 4 tickets for the movie Sister-in-law 10:20 p.m., including 3 tickets for the U22 program and 1 bth ticket. I paid for bth tickets with Movie Pass coupon. However, in the end, the checkout staff used my movie pass to pay for the student ticket, leaving 1 ticket at the original price of 115k for me. It's just the right thing to do in business. I haven't gone to the movies in a long time and I'm under 22 so I don't know exactly how much the student price is. Now when I asked on the page, it was 70k.
		- Y Hira (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): I went to see it on the first day of Tet. While most other stores were closed, the movie theater remained open. The movie theater was clean and I enjoyed the movie itself, so when there's a movie I want to see, the big screen is nice and powerful.
		- Ph∆∞∆°ng Linh B√πi H·ªìng (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): So disappointed, really. Bought VIP Gold Class tickets but was treated worse than customers buying regular theater tickets, with a superficial attitude of just doing it, tricking customers into buying combos and getting free glasses when customers had no need to buy them, especially arbitrarily adding combos. especially without consulting customers. Is this any different from fraud for personal gain???
		- Ch√≠ M√£i ƒê√†o (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): So disappointed that when I went to see Lynx, the theater showed the wrong movie and the corn still smelled like it was burning, and it didn't pop evenly and there were still a lot of corn kernels. ü•π Remember, it's okay to go to CGV at other places. Seeing that it was in a prime location, I thought about experiencing it, but I doubt it was as expected.
		- B·∫£o Qu·ªëc H·ªì (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): At that time, I saw gold class in Dong Khoi, but I think the premium service at this landmark is much better. Staff gives full benefits, staff takes care of the bar continuously. Ring the bell and staff will immediately assist. I think seats in row C are the best for those who are afraid of being close, then sit in row D. Landmark seats are double seats, so please be careful.
		- pyeonghoa (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): I went to CGV and watched a movie two days in a row. One day I saw it at a regular movie theater and the other day I saw it at GOLD CLASS. The movie theater chairs were clean. GOLD CLASS provides a separate space to sit while waiting for the movie to begin, and drinks are also provided for free.
		- qu·ª≥nh nguy·ªÖn ph·∫°m d·∫° (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): December 29, 2024 movie showing at 1pm on ticket but 1:30pm still not available. The staff did not say the reason other than to ask for sympathy and to fix it. After waiting for 1 hour, there was still no movie showing, but the staff kept telling me to wait 10 minutes to fix the machine, I don't know how many times it was 10 minutes, without a single apology, and only waited to ask before saying there were 10 minutes left. The movie is 2 hours long but the wait took 1 hour, and I had to wait in line for dozens of minutes to get a refund. Bad theater, bad service, bad staff
		- Thanh T√¢m Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): The theater has a ticket purchasing area outside that is a bit small, but has almost all of CGV's best theater genres. In terms of display and sound quality, the movie is among the top theaters today. Experience buying tickets online conveniently because there is a separate online ticket counter.
		- H√íA L∆ØU (2.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): The experience in the theater is also temporary. It's Tet so the theater is very empty. The staff went into the room and sat down, but didn't see anything standing at the counter. Not good attitude. The remaining facilities are quite good. Many photo booths. But there are some movies that have been running for a long time and still don't clean up the booth, which is very unsightly. The rest is okay. The air conditioner is quite cold. During the movie, I wanted to freeze to death. The staff doesn't give their best service during Tet holiday... Temporary!
		- MINH L√ä (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): Conveniently located near the house, large under-beam parking space. Right outside there is a convenient cafe area for friends to watch movies and eat and drink together
		- Tu·∫•n Miml (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): CGV Cinema at landmark 81: - the space is so beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è - Enthusiastic and professional staff - The food is quite diverse and delicious üëç - the janitor happily said, "REMEMBER TO TAKE A GLASS OF WATER AND A CAN OF CORN WITH YOU AFTER WATCHING THE MOVIE, PUT IT IN THE TRASH BIN FOR THE janitor, I SAW EVERY TIME YOU FINISH WATCHING THE MOVIE AND DON'T TAKE IT OUT WITH YOU, THEN, THE WORKER HAS TO GO INTO THE THEATER TO CLEAN UP, IT'S TOO TOUGH FOR HER ü•∫ EVERYONE REMEMBERS THIS SMALL AND BIG ACTION üôè THANK YOU SO MUCH, I LOVE YOUR WORK SO MUCH ‚ù§Ô∏è SHE IS JUST LIKE MY MOTHER "
		- Trips of The youth (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Large theater with many waiting seats, spacious and comfortable projection room. The VIP (gold) counter has instant noodles, snacks, tea and coffee. Showtime schedule with many suitable appearances
		- 24_7009 Nguy·ªÖn Minh ƒê·ª©c (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): People in theaters love seats so they sit quite cramped, this is because quite a few customers put their feet on the front seats due to not enough leg room, the seats are quite narrow and sit quite groveling, the IMAX theater I sat in at J19 felt quite low compared to the tiring screen. neck, but it feels like the whole screen will cover you. IMAX has the advantage of using 2 projectors so the movie is brighter, whether the movie is sharp or not depends on the movie, not the projector because Nope I found it blurry nma Avatar is very clear.
		- ÍπÄÏñëÌôò (Mike Kim) (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): CGV, located on the first basement level of Vincom Center Landmark 81, also has an IMAX theater. Regular 2D costs about 135,000 dongs/person. It's convenient because there are various food courts on the same floor, but since it's the weekend, there isn't enough parking space for motorcycles.
		- Lily in 20s (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): The lobby is quite small compared to other CGV theaters. The theater is clean. Staff are very enthusiastic. The price is a bit high but reasonable with the quality of theater, image, and sound.
		- Thu Lieu (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Bought a ticket for 11:10 p.m. but at 11:05 p.m., the doors were closed and I couldn't find a way in. Even though I asked the security guard to lead me to B1, I still couldn't get in. Can't even call the switchboard. Lost 2 tickets and some ridiculous drinks. If you open late if you can't support customers, don't open it. It's a pity there isn't 0 stars üò°
		- Nam Duy Nguy·ªÖn (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): CGV Landmark is one of the largest cinema complexes of the CGV system nationwide. There are 2 high-class theaters here: IMAX and Gold Class. As one of three IMAX theaters in the country, it stands out with a curved screen that is almost twice the size of a regular theater combined with Dolby sound in the space of 3D glasses, which is so wonderful that regular 3D theaters will hardly be able to match it. Comparable to 4.5 times wider and deeper space, creating a more realistic and real-life image. At the same time, Gold Class theater creates a private and comfortable space for couples with soft seats, so it is always more crowded than other theaters. CGV landmark is probably a bargain when investing here, with the effect of the tallest building in Southeast Asia, the number of visitors coming on both weekdays and holidays is crowded, CGV is not inferior. On the other hand, because it's close to home, this is always my familiar entertainment place!
		- Anh Nguy·ªÖn (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): The IMAX theater's curved screen is nothing to complain about, and with nearly 500 seats, it can be said that the IMAX theater has the highest capacity in the Landmark 81 theater. Don't hesitate any longer and come to CGV Landmark 81 to experience the vivid screen space full of all senses.
		- NH√çM Production (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Present on April 5, 2022 to attend the movie premiere. The cinema room is clean, the sound is good, the staff is polite and gives dedicated instructions. ü§üüëç‚ù§Ô∏è ‚Ä¶
		- Ph∆∞∆°ng Th·∫£o (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-06-28): I visited here a few years ago, the difference between the two times was that the theater was empty, the difference was that this time the air conditioning was weak, it felt cool after sitting for a long time. CGV tickets are expensive. When I came in, I brought a water bottle with me, but the employee asked me to keep the water bottle and not bring it in. When I left, I completely forgot about getting the water bottle back ü´†
		- Ng·ªçc D∆∞∆°ng Nguy·ªÖn (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): I have to admit there are many beautiful girls here, the movie isn't very good, the big screen makes my eyes squint :)))
		- JAY CHO (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): There are Korean subtitles, and the ticket price is cheap because it has a Korean view! When purchasing a sweet box (for 2 people), it usually costs about 15,000 won even on a weekend evening, so about 7,500 won per person.  The price is cheaper during the day on weekdays. First of all, since it's inside a shopping mall on the 81st floor, it's nice to be able to see other things as well üëç
		- Thanh Hua (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): The theater is spacious, located near the parking lot escalators so it's easy to find Location at floor B1
		- H Ch√¢u (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-07-28): The theater is clean with some cute staff, the service is very good, enthusiastic support, and the cheese popcorn is delicious ^^
		- Phong L√™ (3.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): IMAX theaters are large, have normal perceived resolution, normal sound, sitting in rows A-G will be very close to the screen, reducing the quality of the movie when watching, the price is quite 3-4 times higher than normal theaters.
		- Nam Do (2.0‚≠ê, 2024-09-28): Bad experience, watching movies in theaters but like pirated websites, images constantly disappear. A horror movie (long legs) that CGV rewinds and rewinds like a comedy. The theater compensates the voucher that the student has for 1 month üòÆ‚Äçüí® ‚Ä¶
		- Cam Huynh (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Large, cool room, good sound. Cleaner than the CGV theaters I've been to
		- T∆∞·ªùng Vy (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-07-28): Highly recommend experiencing the service at the theater here, the staff are cute, take care enthusiastically, the corn at cgv is delicious and crispy, a must try, will come back to watch more often
		- kebong tac (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-09-28): Staff lack consulting knowledge. Mik and his foreign friend want to watch Korean movies. To make sure the movie has English subtitles or not, I asked the staff before buying the ticket. The three staff members gathered and asked one person and the other and then agreed with me that the answer was that Korean movies have both English and Vietnamese subtitles. Zik so mik bought 2 tickets and as a result, the movie only had Vietnamese subtitles. If mik doesn't calm down today, those staff won't be at peace with me.
		- Daisy Anh (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): It's a bit unfortunate that there are no more tickets to enter the imax theater, but in general the quality is very good, the view of the waiting room is also comfortable to check in.
		- Hien The (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Clean, airy, located in an easy-to-find location. Even though I entered the theater, there were still people ringing the bell and talking loudly, but I was not warned.
		- vƒÉn ƒë·∫°t ng√¥ (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): This is a CGV cinema with many theaters equipped with 3D, 2D projection tools and different movie formats. Movie theater ticket prices are publicly listed on CGV's website
		- Ti·∫øn V√µ (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-06-28): Convenient - live in Binh Thanh - eat, drink and watch movies
		- Giang Ng√¢n (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-07-28): The Imax theater has a large curved screen that is great for watching movies, and delicious cheese popcorn! Beautiful decor, good service! There are also goldclass theaters with a rich schedule of shows in many time frames, worth experiencing
		- Frozen Queen Elsa (Bebebietyeu) (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Excellent quality. One of the best cinemas in Ho Chi Minh City. There's the Rap4 GoldClass system as well as excellent 3D and Imax. Recommend everyone to come here to see. The cinema is located in the highest Landmark81 commercial area in Vietnam, so after people finish watching the cinema, they can go sightseeing, play, entertain, and do other shopping. Wishing everyone the best experiences here.
		- Ho√†i Th∆∞∆°ng (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-09-28): Okay, enthusiastic staff
		- L√¢m B·∫£o Nhi (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-07-28): Beautiful theater with cheerful and enthusiastic staff, there are also special theaters, IMAX has a big screen with vivid sound, it's great to watch, Goldclass has a soft mattress and attentive service, I feel satisfied with the money I spent to get it. Such a good experience üòç ‚Ä¶
		- Nh∆∞ Nguy·ªát (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): The theater is spacious, clean, and the toilet is also airy. The day I went was quite empty, the staff was polite.
		- Vo Xuan Hung (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Rate 5* for the employee and supervisor/leader in charge of the evening shift on February 4, the movie Avatar. Highly appreciate the professionalism and handling of the leader's boyfriend. Vote 5* The movie watching area is standard and classy.  Watched the movie, paid parking fee 140k (car), left pocket 120k (lover kept wallet). Luckily, the security guard said there was a 50% discount for watching movies. How lucky!  Cheers,
		- Luna Mai (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): The cinema is large, new, clean! Beautiful decor, good service! There are both Glodclas and Imax theaters, regular theaters, with a variety of show schedules and many time frames
		- 12C11.35.Ph·∫°m Th·ªã M·ªπ Trang (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-07-28): First time experiencing IMAX format in this theater and I really liked it, the theater is super large, the images are vivid and the sound is realistic. Evaluation of the ticket counter and popcorn counter service is very good and fast. Will definitely come back to enjoy upcoming movies
		- Nguy·ªÖn Minh Y·∫øn (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): First time experiencing a gold class screening room here <3 I'm truly a country person coming to the province üò≠üò≠ I'm amazed at everything I see. This room has great sound, more lively than CGV's regular rooms, maybe because the room is smaller. The chair can be adjusted into a bed, extremely enjoyable <3 I hope Da Nang will soon have a theater like this
		- L√ÇM NGUY·ªÑN NG·ªåC (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): The theater is at a temporary level, but the service is good, the consultants are quite enthusiastic, and the support for receiving tickets is also very ok.
		- HO√ÄNG HOA (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): It seems like outsiders are not welcome here. Going to the movies and looking for a parking garage was breathtaking. The theater was quite empty. Probably because the movie isn't hot.
		- Hi·∫øu Nguy·ªÖn Trung (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-08-28): _Right in the center of Saigon so the price of movie tickets is a bit high but acceptable. After going to the movies, saying goodbye is always great. But the most memorable is at Landmark 81 park, taking my girlfriend there dozens of times. The scenery is beautiful, especially when going in the late afternoon, I say it's extremely gorgeous, after going there I don't want to leave, now I see that the memories are priceless.
		- Thu Th·ªßy Pham (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): The i max room is very spacious, I went to see the right avatar, started the movie but the staff forgot to turn off the lights, had to call to turn it off
		- Thu Huy·ªÅn (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-04-28): It's strange to open the movie show late and then lock the door so passersby can dispose of their trash
		- VƒÉn Tu·∫•n Nguy·ªÖn (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-08-28): Advice: Popcorn is higher than the price purchased online. When I asked again, I said I didn't see the combo. The staff did not know how to sell corn and water combos and gave wrong advice to buy a larger package.
		- Anh H√†o Nguy·ªÖn (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): Beautiful, complete
		- Le Nhim (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Enthusiastic and hospitable staff. The cinema is large and comfortable for viewers.
		- M√¨ Chua Cay (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): CGV Vincom Center Landmark 81 is located in the tallest Lanmark building in Vietnam in Ho Chi Minh City, an extremely expensive location, a crowded and famous place of people in Saigon.  - Officially launched to the audience in July 2018, as the 60th theater of the CGV Cinemas movie system.  - Special services available at CGV Vincom Center Landmark 81:  + There are a total of 7 projection rooms equivalent to 1255 seats, full of 2D, 3D, Gold Class, IDMAX projection rooms.  + High-class screening rooms and accompanying high-end services such as free drinks at Gold Class  + There is a majestic IMAX theater room with nearly 500 seats and a large, sharp projection screen  + Vivid Dolby 7.1 standard sound system, realistic images in every detail  + Diverse beverage service, dedicatedly served throughout the movie watching process  - Regularly launch promotions to attract customers to visit.  - Ticket prices range from 90,000 - 250,000, excluding surcharges on weekends and holidays.

		- ngo thinh (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Cgv imax big room. Price 180k/ticket on weekends. Theater right on the 1st floor.
		- ÂåãÊ∏ÖÁê≥ (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-07-28): I have been to this branch many times and sometimes I have had quite bad experiences with the staff here, but today can be said to be an experience that left me speechless. My friend and I told him that we were applying the U22 program, and the staff also checked both of our citizenship identification cards. But when you click on our invoice, you still click on the price saying the program has not been applied yet, so I remind you that you just checked our citizenship IDs but If the U22 price has not been applied, after I told you, you had a very unfriendly attitude towards me, and then you said you forgot. I can accept that you are mistaken or forgot something, but your attitude is very annoying to the other person, especially if I am your customer. If you don't like using discount programs for customers, you can suggest to the company to eliminate this program. Don't have an attitude towards customers when people use these programs. discount program like that. While I went to other branches, the staff happily asked if we had U22, rather than waiting for us to "ask" and then have this attitude. When I bought the popcorn, I told you clearly that I was only getting 2 drinks for 1 corn, but you still arbitrarily clicked the premium combo for me, the difference in money was nothing but What bothers me here is the way it's so arbitrary and disrespectful to customers. I don't know if you guys run sales or something in the parts that sell popcorn or not (and if so, that's a problem with your offering skills to customers) but here it's the customers. Customers have made clear requests about what they need. If you want to offer another Combo that is different from the customer's request, at least you have to tell the customer it's like this, not just keep silent and automatically click and then receive the item. like that. And a few times in the past, I had a bad experience here. The staff, while placing an order for me, still turned around to talk to a few other staff members. I didn't know how urgent they were. What could be wrong is not being able to spend a few minutes to finish processing a customer's order and having to interrupt and talk to someone else like that.
		- Captain America (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): The theater is located in the basement, a bit difficult to find. The space is quite large, beautifully decorated, keeping the typical CGV features. There are Imax, Gold, 3D screening rooms...
		- Minh Qu√¢n Nguy·ªÖn L√™ (3.0‚≠ê, 2024-05-28): On May 27, I went to the theater to buy 2 PeeNak4 tickets for the 8:50 pm show, then I bought 1 Hotdog + 2 glasses of water. The staff asked to borrow my ticket to check the seat number and theater to bring it in. While watching the movie, I looked out to see if anyone was bringing food. But by the end of the movie, I still hadn't received my Hotdog. After watching the movie, I forgot so I went home without asking the staff again... so will I get a refund or something like that??
		- Y·∫øn Vy (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-07-28): The theater is clean, spacious, peach mango, salted cream cheese coffee and Cola corn are very delicious. I recommend everyone to try it. The staff is very enthusiastic and thoughtful. Overall, I really like CGV Vincom Landmark81 and I will visit it often.
		- H·ªìng Anh B√πi (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-07-28): I came here on Sunday, there were quite a few customers but the staff were still very enthusiastic. Happy advice, cheese corn mixed with caramel is very delicious. Wide Imax screen, very good movie watching experience. Will stop by again
		- Giathuan Phan (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Employees do business separately and do not accumulate points for customers
		- Good Things (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-08-28): I haven't finished watching the movie yet but I see a bunch of other people rushing into the theater, and they say they're probably advertising, I don't know where all the staff have gone???
		- Mai Xu√¢n (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-07-28): cgv landmark's imax format is really great, lovely staff. Especially when I went to see the gold class, I found the service very good, the corn was delicious (recommend you try mixing 2 flavors) and the drink menu was also very diverse ü´∂üèª in general, it's a compliment, 10 points is not possible but ‚Ä¶
		- s∆°n nguy·ªÖn (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-07-28): The theater is clean and fragrant, I feel satisfied, the staff is lovely. Delicious cheese corn, quick service. I've never been to Gold Cinema before, but I heard it was ok so I'll try it next time

reviews:
		- Geoff Edwards (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-14): It's a buffet with the standard buffet food.. Loads of mud craps and shrimps along with mud mussels. Selection of sushi. And Vietnamese salads. There is a little bit of European food. But I found the roast lamb very dry along with the vegetables. Pehaps through lack of demand.. French fries were cold and coated in a horrible cheese dust most probably full of processed chemicals. Steak was cooked to order. And even though they are very small portions. The grill chef did know how to cook a steak. But the mushroom. And pepper sauce were very watery and did lack flavour and body. Unfortunately we Europeans do like are food hot. Unless we are eating salads... But the majority of the food was lukewarm which is not very pleasant at the best of times. In the dessert department. They all looked very pretty and tempting. But unfortunately absolutely tasteless.. Tirosomo is surpose to be coffee flavoured... But there was no taste of coffee only a after taste of processed cream substitute.. Not pleasant at all. The jelly's again looked beautiful. But had no taste or flavour. And for the price. We paid 540 dong per person. I don't think we woukd go again. Service was good.. And are server definitely deserved a tip.. To which we gave her directly. Knowing that she woukd be able to keep it for herself....
		- Apple B (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): I was amazed by the quantity of seafood available . It was constantly refilled, and the quality was quite fresh considering the price. In addition to the seafood, there were many other options, including beef, local dishes, and a nice variety of desserts. The only downside for me was how crowded it was; it felt a little stuffy at times. Overall, a great spot for seafood lovers, and definitely worth trying!
		- Jonathan Yaohan Lee (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Would probably say this is indeed a premium buffet spread in Saigon. Have been to really good buffets in Kuala Lumpur and of course Singapore.  The quality of food is nearly there but it surpasses many Vietnamese buffet. The spread is overwhelming and we enjoyed the steamed crabs and sashimi!  There was steak and a grilled meat section but it seemed overwhelmed by the seafood spread!  Great selection of salad and I would come again for sure.
		- Annie Anh Do (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Very impressive for a seafood buffet with reasonable prices. We went there for lunch with our supplier and we enjoyed the buffet very much, which was excellent with lots of flavour. The desserts were delicious too. We will definitely come back there again.
		- Jenny Ho (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): Not the biggest variety but the quality of what they do have is there. More catered to seafood lovers with the clams, oysters, prawns, snails. Also a minimal selection of sushi and sashimi. Handful of dim sum items but everything seemed to be made pretty fresh. I mainly focused on the seafood. Was happy they had the coconut sauce snails. For $20 usd. Not bad for me but a luxury to locals. Beverages are not included, even water!
		- Huy Hoang (3.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Food was okay, but the service was poor. An old man was using his hands to pick up food, and the waitress did not bother to speak up. d√¢n tr√≠ q√∫a t·ªá.
		- Philbert Salve (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): The best value for money. If you‚Äôre seeking for variety, this is the right place for you. The steak is to die for. This place is a must pig out
		- Vi·ªÖn Ph√∫c Tr·∫ßn (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-14): Good
		- ƒê√¥ng Ho√†ng Th√°i Nh·∫•t (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): I went on a Sunday night, the restaurant was quite crowded so there were no tables, but the staff was still very nice, saved my phone number and called back after about an hour and a half. Even though it was crowded, the service was still quick, clearing the plates continuously.   The food was plentiful, especially the fresh seafood, medium size and changed daily. The dishes were kept warm on an electric tray, each dish had a stove to fill the food right on the spot so there was no fear of it getting cold, I really liked this point. Oysters, panacotta and ice cream were outstanding, delicious and high quality. The salad bar, fruit, dimsum, Vietnamese - Japanese dishes were all diverse and easy to choose.   Small minus points: The buffet ticket did not include water, had to order separately (filtered water is charged), and the space was a bit hot when crowded. The toilet was not located in the restaurant but had to walk quite far outside - not very convenient for the elderly.
		- B·ªôi Ch√¢u Quan (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-07): I went on a Sunday evening so it was quite crowded. In terms of food, Riviu has many dishes, the seafood is fresh and the meat is big and firm. The food is filled continuously and kept hot on the tray. Each dish has a stove standing right inside to continuously fill it, so I really like this. The food line has Japanese dishes, dim sum, Vietnamese dishes, seafood, rice, noodles and meat of all kinds. The salad and fruit bar, tea counter has many options, cakes and flan panacotta yogurt, especially the ice cream is very delicious because it is not sweet, the soft ice cream is very delicious. The restaurant's space is not too big, so when it's winter, the air conditioner can't cool you down, so it's very hot when you sit there. Cute staff. Clean disk continuously. If you want to go to the toilet, you have to go outside and go quite a distance. Getting older will take a bit of effort. The minus point is that the ticket price does not include drinks, drinks must be charged separately. Tickets + drinks + vat are about 600 per adult. I think it's worth eating here because the food is of very good quality. If I have a chance, I will go eat again üòÅ
		- Qu·ª≥nh Di·ªÖm (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Overall assessment of first experience: *I booked a table at 7pm on Wednesday* - Space: relatively medium, crowded, U-shaped food line, not too diverse dishes so the food space is relatively small, focusing on exploiting more seating for customers - Service: good, staff is always on duty, clears dishes quickly, chefs standing at the counters are friendly and welcoming - Food: okay. Depending on the delicious dish, the temporary dish depends on each person's taste. + Seafood is a strong point, filled continuously, including grilled onions and cheese,.... + Beefsteak is ok, soft and not tough, everyone. + Dimsum is also very good, kimsa dumplings and premium shrimp dumplings are super delicious + Dessert line (yogurt, tea, panna cotta, ice cream, cakes,...) diverse, delicious, less sweet ice cream is good - Price: okay :))) Tickets are 10k cheaper than D'maris or something, but they don't have free drinks, a big minus. The food line is not diverse, the spices are also relatively good. The ticket price for me is 645k per person including ticket  Overview: okay. Suitable for families with grandparents and adults who like to eat a lot of seafood.
		- Hu·ª≥nh Th·ªã Thanh Nh√†n (R·ªìng kim) (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): I had the opportunity to visit this branch on a Sunday morning and discovered that the restaurant was quite crowded and needed to book a table in advance. I feel like it's quite cramped for 6 people because it's in the corner. When one person wants to leave, the other two people have to stand and go out first. It's quite inconvenient. The food is outstanding, the seafood is famous for being fresh, and the food is constantly refilled. Staff are quick and provide enthusiastic service. Price 565k/person Not including VAT + drinks
		- Tram TTP (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Another branch of the Cuu Van Long system, very crowded on weekends, the floor is a bit slippery. Tables are quite close together, so there is not much private space. Dishes come out very quickly, only the steak counter is long wait. Fresh seafood dishes, fresh sushi. Many desserts, tea not too sweet. Price does not include water.
		- V√µ Nguy·ªÖn Thanh Nhi (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-14): I went on a Sunday night when all the tables were full and I couldn't book in advance, but when I arrived at the restaurant, the staff still saved my phone number and called back about an hour and a half later. It's crowded on weekends but the staff still serves quickly and clears dishes continuously. The dishes are diverse and the seafood is about 90% fresh, the size seems to change daily. Most of the dishes are very delicious and delicious (some yogurt is a bit of a fail). Buffet tickets do not include drinks, so when dining, remember to bring wet towels (the restaurant has gloves + dry paper towels for free, wet towels are charged). Compared to the general price range, it's quite good, worth a try.
		- YUMYUM _HCM (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): There are a ton of customers, but they keep filling up the food so there's no shortage and the staff is friendly. Not only a variety of seafood, but also various foods including Western and Vietnamese are available. Above all, the seafood is fresh and of good quality for the price. However, please note that the spacing between tables is narrow and there are too many customers so it is noisy.
		- Hi·∫øu Ng√¢n Nguy·ªÖn L√™ (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): I went to eat on the opening day, it was super crowded but the quality of service and stolen food was very good. The line counter is full of items that look pleasing to the eye, not cheap. The dessert bar has super delicious pana cotta, lots of fruit sauce, and no additional charge. Not a luxury space, suitable for families with very old parents
		- –•–∞–Ω—è –ß–∞–Ω (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): 1. The restaurant space is very airy and clean, tables and chairs are neatly arranged to fit the aisles, and paintings hanging on the walls create a harmonious highlight. 2. Diverse food: seafood, shrimp, crabs, crabs, mussels, oysters, snails, dumplings, sushi, sasimi, Vietnamese dishes, European dishes, and many types of sweet desserts. The way to prepare dishes is diverse and has a suitable taste. Food is added continuously, never lacking. 3. The receptionists are gentle and give instructions to the table. The waiters and waitresses were also polite and enthusiastic. 4. The only negative point: do not wish the guest a happy birthday, if the guest is not a Diamond member. This differentiates customers too much, making them feel a bit sorry for themselves. If it's your first time coming to eat, how can you register as a member?
		- Hien Khanh (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): The food is diverse, delicious, and of uniform quality. I like country market food, there are all kinds of banh xeo and khot, there is a hot dim sum counter of all kinds, and a rich dessert counter. Compared to competitor Poisedon, the price is slightly higher but the food is better. Communicate enthusiastically, clear the table continuously.
		- Di·ªáp Phi L∆∞u (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): Buffet is nearly 600k per adult, crabs and crabs are very delicious, meat is firm Ice cream and desserts are unique, varied and delicious The staff is new so they are not very experienced
		- Jenny Vani (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): Having eaten at a few famous buffet places in Singapore, I find the biggest plus point is the extremely enthusiastic and dynamic staff service. Always help me pack up food The food is fresh, ok. Today I eat very fresh crabs. Crabs are not very fresh, probably because the quantity is too large and unlucky. Stable space
		- Sarah Thu (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): The squid here is very fresh and delicious, and the crabs are also very big. Everyone, the fresh seafood I eat here is very suitable for your taste. You must book a table in advance, especially on weekends. You must book in advance otherwise there will be no table. The ticket price is also high. Fit
		- Sam Dao (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): Our team of 15 people went to dinner buffet from 5pm so it was still airy and comfortable. The dishes are diverse and delicious. Fill dishes continuously. You should go eat early, because when the table is full, I feel quite stuffy and noisy, no longer comfortable.
		- ni quach (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): Fresh seafood./ herring is ok üòò Sweet dishes (sweet soup, cakes, ice cream) are just right and not too sweet. üíê Should increase the temperature. A bit hot and stuffy.
		- Anna Wong (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-14): Those who like to eat seafood today are fine, but don't worry
		- Uyen Phanquocle (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-07): Located in a landmark building, the seafood buffet has many types of fresh seafood, very reasonable prices, lots of crabs, firm crabs, slightly spicy dipping sauce, good service.
		- Huy Nguy·ªÖn (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): The day I went, it was quite crowded, but the staff took care of it accurately and enthusiastically. My baby had his own seat so his parents could eat and drink comfortably.
		- Hoang Loc Ngo (Jaden Ngo) (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): The space is spacious, the tables and chairs are clean. If you go early, it will be quite quiet and comfortable, around 6:30 to 7:00 it will be more crowded. The menu is rich in dishes from meat to seafood, and desserts. Fresh seafood, food is filled continuously, no need to worry about running out of dishes. The staff serve enthusiastically and provide thoughtful support.
		- Thi·ªán NƒÉng (2.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Space and tables are very tight. The important thing is that very few crabs can wait for 1 meal at a time, thank goodness
		- Ha Phuong Thao (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): My family and I had a complete experience here, the food is varied, the chef fills constantly, even though it is crowded, there is no crowding or long waiting for food, the staff is also enthusiastic, everyone organizes birthday parties. Japanese here, very good nvien
		- Qu√Ω Nhi Nguy·ªÖn th·ªã (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): Today, December 21, my family and I came to have a meal. The enthusiastic staff led us to the table, with an extremely welcoming attitude‚ù§Ô∏è They served very quickly and supported our table very well‚ù§Ô∏è I appreciate it. Very high service here‚ù§Ô∏è thank you staff for providing an extremely wonderful experience‚ù§Ô∏è
		- Minh Nh∆∞ (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): The first time I ate at Parc Mall, it was quite good, so I recommended my friends to try Landmark, but this experience was not fun for me.  As for the food, it's still delicious, the seafood is bigger than the first time I went, but the day I went again there was no crab, while I mainly went to CVL to eat crab, so I felt a bit disappointed.  But I still sympathize that maybe because of the weather there weren't enough students. What made me feel extremely uncomfortable was that the school was extremely noisy. When I went to eat a buffet in a restaurant, I thought I was at a pub somewhere. , a whole company of nearly 40 people had a New Year's Eve party, shouted loudly, and after drinking beer, they even organized a game right at the restaurant??? They don't have to shout loudly, but rather try to scream as loudly as possible, which can greatly affect others. I looked around and everyone was frowning in discomfort, but I didn't see any warning from the restaurant?? ? Those guys don't know how to be reasonable, but the manager should also know how to respect other customers. I'm not asking for a quiet space but this is too noisy. Imagine 40 people screaming together and you'll understand how loud it is. , so loud that it made my head hurt while eating, an extremely bad experience
		- Tr·∫ßn Ng·ªçc B√≠ch (3.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): The seating is very cramped, one table is next to another. Initially, no staff mentioned that the line counter closes for lunch at 1:40 p.m., so I booked a table at 12:00 p.m. If there had been notice, I would have booked a table earlier. It took 15-20 minutes to get to the table and order drinks, so we only had 1 hour to sit and eat. If you're not full, you'll have to go home. The store's website also does not clearly state the lunch break time so customers are disappointed in the middle of their meal. In general, anyone who eats should learn from the experience of eating at 11am.
		- D∆∞∆°ng Ng√¥ (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): The space is beautiful, airy, hot food is constantly filled by the chef, the staff is cute and enthusiastic and very skillful, you should experience it.
		- Mai Tr√¢m LT (2.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): I went on a Monday afternoon, the restaurant was quite crowded, the service was okay, but the food was not good, the clam dishes were not very fresh, the crabs were so-so, not sure about the meat, similar to the sushi dishes. The last time the dim sum was delicious, this time the skin was dry, maybe left out too long or reheated something, I don't know. Only beefsteak and dessert are still as delicious as before. The conclusion is that next time I won't visit again, I'll go find another place.
		- Quy Duong (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): The squid and crabs are edible or delicious, but the slightly fried crabs don't have much of a taste
		- Father San (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): My group of 18 friends and I booked a table in advance at Cuu Van Long Landmark 81 buffet, B1 floor - City. HCM, on the evening of Monday December 16, 2024. When you arrive, the staff will guide you to the table. The staff is very friendly and polite, demonstrating professionalism. After taking the crabs and crabs at the counter and bringing them to the table, I used my bare hands to break the crabs open. At that moment, a male employee came and took a nylon glove wrapped in a paper bag and placed it on the table, giving it to me and politely said. : "The restaurant has gloves for customers to use so they don't get their hands dirty" I just saw - maybe because I love shrimp and crab and lack of observation! I thanked the waiter and he thanked me back and continued, "If you need anything, just call." Coming to have dinner here, I realized that all the clips posted online about the food at Cuu Van Long are all truthful: crayfish, crabs, snails, tuna, salmon, beef, chicken. ...tea and ice cream are all refilled so diners don't have to worry about running out, so there's no jostling. I give the restaurant 5 stars because: attentive and professional service; Delicious food, full of seafood as advertised; Reasonable price compared to the food. I will return to this place with my family after having a wonderful experience at this restaurant.
		- Tr√∫c Nguy·ªÖn (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): There's nothing to complain about except eating a lot of fat ü§®
		- M·∫´n Nghi Nguy·ªÖn (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): The food is so abundant, delicious, fresh, there are many choices for everyone from Asian to European dishes, suitable for Vietnamese tastes. The service is good, but because the restaurant is crowded, the staff will take a little longer to serve.
		- Brian nguy·ªÖn (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): Maybe everything on the outside is great but the way the office department works is very bad. I just got a reception receipt but waited for the email but didn't receive it, asked for it but didn't get a response. Maybe next time we have guests, we should choose another restaurant. Family dining is ok, but I probably won't choose this place again for work.
		- Minh Nguyen (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): There are too many customers compared to the staff so the staff can cover all the customers. Buffet 100 food is fried or grilled with onions or grilled cheese to quickly fill you up. Crabs have a chance of rotting, so if you eat them, remember to burn them or else you'll get caught.
		- V√µ Mi√™n (2.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): After calculating the payment, I request a VAT invoice. The employee gave me a piece of paper with company information and related information written down. I'm thinking this is 2025, not 1990, but I hand out a paper that requires customers to fill in information. It's easy to make mistakes, easy to get lost, and very inadequate. When I asked again, the staff here said that my Chief Accountant had such regulations, and the response was also very harsh and sophisticated. I have no need to return to this restaurant ever again.
		- xuan tien le (Alex) (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): Delicious food, always available so always full
		- VI Y·∫æN (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): When I asked what kind of water there was in the drink, I was not informed that the price for a glass of water was 55k per glass, which was PERSONAL, making me think it was in the buffet, drinking 6 glasses for 330k was very deceiving customers.
		- L·∫πo 7 (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-22): Not doing business properly, keeping quiet after getting information, refusing to issue invoices to customers despite repeated phone reminders!
		- Tr·∫ßn Trung (2.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): Traveling with 6 people cost 3,600,000 VND, first time going to a buffet for over 500k but no water, had to spend extra money to buy drinks :))) The line counter has few dishes but the quality is normal, nothing special. The seating is cramped, the space is stuffy and hot. Went for the first time out of curiosity, will never go back.
		- Thanh Truc Nguyen Thi (2.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): The counters are not as diverse as other branches. There is no waiting room for customers to check in, even though they have booked a table, but when they arrive, they are clumsy and wait for a long time. Staff has an unpleasant attitude towards customers. quite messy and less luxurious, in addition, the smell management in the restaurant space is quite poor
		- Hoan Nguyen Huu (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): Full service - most main dishes, especially seafood, are very diverse, high-class & luxurious ‚Äî- but I would like to suggest 2 side dishes that should be overlooked: 1- Soup: Seafood, a bit bland, simple simple. Can be enhanced: crab, chicken, poire beans, asparagus... 2- crab vermicelli: the crab flavor is very bland, it must be rich in crab quality and the broth needs to be better - I haven't eaten pho, but the pho must be delicious like the best products in HCM‚Äîand maybe reduce some of the slightly duplicated seafood that seems redundant!                          One more important note: the image of the restaurant's facade needs to be more formal, more prominent, more modern, more luxurious, to match the prime location of the restaurant at Landmark and also need to make the rooms Eat brighter and more beautiful inside!‚Äî Commenter = 1 Old physician originally from Saigon.
		- Minh Nguy√™ÃÉn VƒÉn (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): Reserved a table for 10 people a week in advance but the seats were in the corner and there wasn't enough space so we had to sit close together. It was hot and sweat soaked our shirts. The food was normal, the crab meat wasn't firm.
		- Ng·ªçc L√™ (3.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): This is my personal experience: the space is messy and difficult to get to.. the counter is far away, the service is poor, the food is not much. There are a lot of customers and a little food. very noisy, messy space.
		- Th√†nh ƒê·∫°t Tr·∫ßn (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): Delicious, better quality than the previous 2 orders!
		- PNJ CTY (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): Not following the rules of the system (not accepting a table when booking a ticket for 1 person) Never heard or known about the famous system... that doesn't allow 1 person to use the Cua Van Long buffet, it's confusing and offensive.
		- Huy Nguy·ªÖn (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): The table reservation service is very bad. I booked a table for Tuesday (January 31, 2024) but the person booking the table set the date (January 4, 2025). I brought an adult to dine, but that was really frustrating. contacted, and did not receive any message to confirm the reservation from the date of the call (December 29, 2024, 7:46 p.m.)
		- Heidi Schubert (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): We were there on Friday evening. The food was very good. The staff friendly and helpful. At around 7 p.m. the restaurant was full and it was quite loud. But a good way to taste the whole Seafod. A reservation makes sense.
		- huyen ngo (3.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): Yesterday I just came home from eating and 2 hours later I vomited it all up, the crab was not fresh and the meat was fried, all the dishes tasted very normal, not worth the money, I lost a lot of money.
		- Nga Phan (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): Well, the customers who come in to eat must be rich and luxurious in Saigon, everyone. But I'm afraid in Ben Tre that I can sell my rice to people to eat and tell people. I just walked in to some country guards and said that by looking at it, I know it's a country house. Oh my god, people come from the country and have endless money. And they're so rich that they have to go talk to other people. I'm so proud that there wasn't one at that meal. I'm sure they'll be cursing. I'll spend my money eating somewhere else. Let's check the guard's rude attitude at the restaurant.
		- L·ª±c Thi·ªáu (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): The first time I came to experience CVL premium, I stood in line but the staff grouped around 4-5 people and took care of only 1 customer until another group came forward and then continued to pick up the group of customers so I could stand and watch. After I reminded him that I was also waiting, he apologized. In the same segment, perhaps the word premium should be removed when the service is not yet professional. Hope it will improve
		- Qu·ª≥nh Anh (2.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): The place is cramped and the service staff is not cheerful. The girls serving in the area opposite the hot food and sushi counter did not look cheerful towards the customers.
		- Happy PBT (3.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): The staff taking reservations is not professional, there are no parking instructions, the restaurant is narrow, the atmosphere is hot...
		- Khanh ƒê·∫∑ng Th·ªã Kim (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): The food is abundant, diverse, and fresh. Enthusiastic staff, ok, just a bit cramped
		- hu·ª≥nh hu·ª≥nh Tu·∫•n (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Too bad, too crowded, no place to get food, food not fresh and after eating I had a stomach ache and diarrhea.
		- Marcus Nguyen (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): The food here is delicious, the restaurant is crowded in the evening, I will come back when I have a chance
		- Triethiep Truong (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): Or chase customers away with the excuse that there are customers in front of them even though there are still many empty tables
		- Nhi Nguy·ªÖn (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-14): Great
		- Cindy Trinh (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): The service was extremely good, the staff and chefs were very supportive and the food was delicious
		- Ho√†ng Fe (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): Had a meal with my family, everyone from adults to kids loved it, will come back!!
		- Tram Luong Thi Thuy (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): The messenger hotline staff responds to customers very poorly, like cursing in the customer's face, which is unacceptable.
		- LONG LE (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): For those who like shrimp and crab, this is the ideal place.
		- Th√∫y Nguy·ªÖn (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): The space is narrow, the seats are not spacious, and it's hot
		- ÍπÄÍµ¨ÎèÖ (3.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): That's just it... I don't recommend it.
		- ∆†i, My ƒë√¢y! (Review ch√¢n th·∫≠t) (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Cuu Van Long would be more reasonable if it adjusted the lunch time slot. It opens at 11am and the line closes at 1:40pm. If you're late and can't eat, you'll be so angry.
		- Truong Nguyen (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-26): In general, the shrimp and crab here are very good, no one competes with them. But I forgot to take pictures. Take only one photo. Sympathy encroaches on eating and taking pictures, which is more than enough
		- Di√™m Nguy·ªÖn Vi·∫øt (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-23): Fresh seafood and many types of food, not just seafood such as vermicelli soup, sashimi, fried foods. But the specialty is seafood dishes. The staff is enthusiastic. Change plates continuously. The dining table has dry paper towels. And there are hair ties for girls. There is also dental floss. The dessert counter has a variety of cakes and sweet soups. There is no toilet in the restaurant. You have to go outside to use the building's toilet. The tables are a bit close together. Everyone should go to avoid rush hour at 7pm. Because it is too crowded. And you should book a table in advance to avoid waiting.
		- Dragon Nine (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): The food fork is placed on a black plate. The situation is that I dropped the fork and broke a piece. So the staff asked for compensation. The suggestion is that in situations like this, it is easy to drop it when crowded and the food tongs have many hooks that are easy to get caught, so it is best to use stainless steel forks in these positions to avoid trapping customers in paying unnecessary money. Moreover, because of this little thing, losing a customer who contributes to CVL twice a month is really not worth it!
		- Khoi TRUONG DINH (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): The price is equivalent to the quality, the staff is happy, the food is constantly added. The dishes are quite delicious The crab is especially delicious The beef is also tender

reviews:
		- Ken Wong (3.0‚≠ê, 2024-07-28): WinMart Landmark 81 offers a wide range of products but falls short in customer service, with few staff members able to speak English or effectively promote items. The labeling, pricing, and rack arrangement are quite confusing, making it difficult for shoppers to navigate and find what they need. Improving these aspects would greatly enhance the shopping experience. While the store has potential, significant improvements in organization and staff training are necessary to meet international standards and better serve all customers.
		- Edwin Petrus (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-04-28): WinMart Landmark 81 is a supermarket that offers daily needs from fresh foods, frozen foods, packed foods, beverages, fruits, vegetables, instant foods, cleaning utensils, bathroom utensils, etc. The products offered here were quite complete. Payment can be made by cash and electronic modes.
		- Nel C (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): I love this place. It has everything you need. Reasonable price. There's also a small section that sells cooked food and meals. Thing is, there are so much food places here, that's why it's a small section.  I would prefer more selection of pot noodles although there are two isles of packet noodles. Pot noodles you can get from convenience stores. The lines are usually very short and they are efficient. There is a freshly squeezed oj machine at the entrance. They also deliver to Vinhomes.
		- Genta (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-08-28): VinMart at Vinpearl Landmark 81 is a great spot to shop for souvenirs and local Vietnamese products. They have a wide selection of items, from snacks to unique gifts, making it super convenient to pick up something special. Perfect for grabbing a little piece of Vietnam to take home with you!
		- Kevin Smith (2.0‚≠ê, 2024-05-28): Supermarket offering ok, lack of customer service a major concern, especially at the checkouts where there are rarely enough people serving and a lack of willingness to address. Having to weigh fruit and veg to get a price label before going to checkout also seems an unnecessary step which many people forget to do which then ends up in more delays. Not a bad place but poorly organized.
		- Larry Gmail (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-07-28): Terrible management and worst customer service!. We bought a small egg package, and when walking out of the store, we found out it was leaking. We asked CS for an exchange, and they let us wait for 30 min and returned with a video clip from security camera, Lol, saying that "it was still good when check out". We end up buy a new one, It not the money, they should take care the customer first. Because of couple dollars they will lose their customer satisfaction. The management team must go to the US and learn from the Walmart, Target, Roger, and Alberson chains. Vuong Nhat Pham shouldn't get into this business at all. Merchandise prices are at this market, but it is not the point. We will not return !!!
		- Tu Nguyen (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-07-28): BEWARE of non-Vietnamese scammers, they‚Äôre travelling in a pack with children, look like legitimate tourists, they‚Äôll come and ask you about Viet currency and where are you from in English, then ask you to show you country currency, others will distract your friends or family members as soon as you show them the money they‚Äôll do their magic and make your money disappear with out you realise it.  Happened to me, so considered you have been warned. Not Vinmart fault but one star rate would get your attention.
		- Anton Dolenko (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Good supermarket
		- quang vu xuan (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-09-28): Ok
		- Christina P (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Decent supermarket inside the Landmark 81 mall.
		- Gut Piew Say (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-04-28): Nice neighbour mall
		- Nguyen Luong Hung (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-10-28): WinMart is a supermarket system belonging to Masan Group, Vietnam. WinMart's products are very diverse with many different types and brands. WinMart is one of the retail brands that Vietnamese customers trust and choose whenever they need to shop. There are more than 40 thousand items of cosmetics, food, household appliances, household appliances, toys, fashion, etc. that can fully meet your family's needs. WinMart supermarkets are often located in residential areas and central areas to create convenience for customers. I love shopping every month at Winmart Vincom Lamdmart 81 üåπüåπüòçüòç‚ù§‚ù§üòÄüòÄ
		- Mei Cao (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): I don't know if it's the whole Winmart system or just this branch that often has promotional signs with discounts, buy 2 get 1 free... but charges the original price. The staff talked very smoothly and did not admit their mistakes at all. I have been caught in the trap more than once and many other customers have also reported it. Everyone, please check your bill carefully!  ----- The round cashier wearing glasses is very cheeky with older people. The other day, I saw a U60 customer ask something, then said "I'm a cashier, so I should know." Little cashier: "HEY YOU!? I'm a cashier, not... what do you know?" spoke loudly to Ms. U60 while still charging other customers.  When I meet my children and grandchildren at my house, I can't even finish my sentence üòÄ. 1*  Suddenly I remember this same girl when she first came to work (still wearing a white shirt, not a uniform), I charged her for buy 2 get 1 free but she scanned it 3 times, I asked to check again and was in front. I asked another employee: "This lady said buy 2 get 1 free". I remember you, my child üòÄ. Next time you won't be gentle anymore.
		- LOUIS PHAN (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): -Service is quite ok, there are often events to experience new products on weekends. -The space is quite large compared to many stores in the same system, selling food and seating for customers. -Some staff have a not very friendly attitude.
		- 1016_V√µ Minh Thu·∫≠n (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): Went down to eat twice as if it was the same time. Mai Phuong took advantage of Mai Phuong's attitude towards the guests and threw the food on the table. What's the point of doing a service job if you have a bad attitude?
		- Nh∆∞0310 ATUS (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-09-28): I think the staff attitude at this landmark is much better than at Vinmart Thao Dien. Never go back to Vinmart Thao Dien, move to Vinmart landmark which is much better, after buying things, there is a park in front to cool off and browse!
		- chonlatit Jetdatsakorn (3.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): The supermarket sells clothes that are comparable to MM market's only sandals, the price of which is higher than the market. The security guards in white shirts looked like their fathers, especially the bald guy. The first time I went to the supermarket to buy things without being able to push the cart out, I had to carry 4.5 heavy bags and it was extremely inconvenient. The bald security guard stopped the cart from being pushed out with a rude attitude and rude words. No wonder Winmark can't develop. Because I was given a voucher so I just went, but now I don't even want to go to these three supermarkets, now I never dare to come back here. Buying things and spending money to buy them is like going to charity.
		- Ng·ªçc Ng√¥ (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-06-28): WM LM81 staff is very cute, always bowing and smiling when looking at customers, enthusiastically assisting customers in finding products to buy. The space is spacious, airy and has a variety of products. I will come back to support many times.
		- Duy Trieu (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Lanmark duck bamboo noodle stall 81 on February 7 at 11am Male waiter's attitude: buy 2 duck bamboo shoot noodles, one part gives you neck and wings, one part doesn't give any pieces of duck Making food for guests is like a pot of pork bran When the customer asked for dipping sauce, he showed an attitude
		- HUYEN QUACH MAI (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): The cashier at the food counter treats customers with a very rude attitude. The supermarket should review its service method otherwise it will lose customers and lose more and more customers.
		- Nga Nguy·ªÖn (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): Cakh does not have .  Every time there is an incident, no manager is present even though the supermarket is open. The billing staff makes constant mistakes. There is no salesperson for the booth.  Bought a drink in the afternoon and delivered it to the lobby before 10pm, but by 11pm, no one had called to deliver or reschedule. Service is very bad and weak.
		- nghi Le (3.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): On December 20, around 7:10 p.m. to 7:20 p.m., I slipped and fell because the staff cleaned the wet floor without posting a warning sign. It's very dangerous for customers to slip and fall ü•πü•πü•πü•π ‚Ä¶
		- Ph√°t Tr·∫ßn (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-14): The checkout counter staff had an unpleasant attitude while I did nothing
		- An An (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-08-28): Ok, but not too much fresh fish.
		- Quy√™n Phan Th·ªã (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): Actually, I find that the staff, especially the security guards here, are not as friendly as I thought. This is the first time I went to the winmart branch in this landmart but the experience was not as good as I thought. It's not that I'm being mean, but there are some security guards here who only care about talking and laughing and don't pay any attention to the guests. Not only that, but also show attitude towards customers I am extremely dissatisfied with this situation.
		- li√™n ng·ªçc (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-09-28): Enthusiastic staff, good incentive program, cute talking cashier
		- Quy√™n Tr∆∞∆°ng Tr√∫c (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): 40k lunch box full of potatoes and 3 patties. It's really funny to see. Where rice is cooked, there is where it is raw
		- Ph·ª•ng B·∫£o (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-09-28): Friendly staff, easy shopping, diverse goods
		- Shin Taka (3.0‚≠ê, 2024-06-28): I've been shopping here about once a week for five years.  The lady in the photo is a bad person who doesn't stand in line and cuts in! Why would the cashier handle such a despicable and disgusting person first?  I would give it 5 stars if they didn't deal with this unpleasant lady at the register firstü§©
		- Ngoc Nh∆∞ (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-09-28): Cashier is happy, checks out quickly, works well. One day, I was careless about looking at promotion information, and the cashier enthusiastically supported me. Very satisfied
		- lan chi (2.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): Evaluating for my Japanese friend who recently bought goods at Winmart, I saw the phenomenon of Thu Ngan arbitrarily rounding money to the disadvantage of the customer. For example, today my friend's bill was 50,222 VND, the staff calculated 51k and gave it back to you. I'm 49k. There have been a few times like this, although the amount of money is very small but it makes customers feel very uncomfortable. How many times a day does this happen to customers, where does that money go??? Winmart should have even prices, not odd numbers and then force customers to pay when they don't volunteer
		- Huy Anh (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-10-28): My friend who works here has to sign something and give his ID to the security guard in the warehouse to let him work. While I was working, my friend's blood sugar dropped so I picked him up and went to the warehouse to get his ID. He wouldn't let me. He asked me to have a guarantor to let me get it. I was so angry. I followed him into the warehouse with my friend and he let me get it =))) Can I ask if I have the right to keep other people's IDs here? Do you have any license for that?
		- Th·∫£o Nguy√™n L√™ Ho√†ng (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-10-28): The cashier didn't pay attention to the bill, but instead laughed and joked, then clicked on it when the customer hadn't yet transferred the money, so he couldn't print the bill. He had to pay twice. They called him to the service counter to complete the refund procedure, but after waiting for a long time, he still hadn't seen the money :)) I felt like I'd lost money. That's bad. Update: after 8 days, today is September 9th, the bank will refund the supermarket money to me
		- TinVlog (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-09-28): Enthusiastic staff, goods are always fresh and of excellent quality. Very trust this place
		- Ng·ªçc Nam Nguy·ªÖn (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-09-28): Rich and diverse goods for all audiences. Supermarkets have many promotions that I find are very suitable for my spending. These promotions are also necessary for consumers' purchasing needs.
		- Th·ªã Nhung Ph·∫°m (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-10-28): During a sale, when you check out and can't get the sale, tell them there's no sale. If it's not on sale, then remove the sale sign so it won't be mistaken.
		- Anh Nguyen (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-09-28): The bread counter is not hygienic. I bought 2 cakes and both I and my friend had stomachaches. I suspect the bread has been sitting for a long time, so I asked to review the bread counter and product quality
		- Trong Nguyen (2.0‚≠ê, 2024-09-28): Winmarrt is getting worse and worse, before 9:55 a.m. you can still buy things freely, now at 9:45 a.m. customers are blocked from accepting payments.. checkout is super slow
		- Tu Tu (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-07-28): Buy 2 fish for 49k. There's too much ice at the ice counter and it doesn't smell or something. Carry it back to the parking lot and the smell is so foul. If you have 2 fish, it would be too much work to exchange them, so you have to give them up. Everyone, please consider buying iced fish here.
		- √Çn Nguy·ªÖn H·ªìng (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Diverse goods
		- L·ªôc L√™ H·ªØu (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-09-28): The supermarket is decorated to look beautiful and airy, creating a comfortable feeling for customers when entering the supermarket. Rich and diverse goods
		- hvsjmn27 (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-09-28): Fraudulent sales, different prices on shelves, different prices at checkout, inappropriate staff attitudes
		- Tr√∫c L√™ (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-09-28): St was changed to a new, more eye-catching model. Diverse goods, enthusiastic and cheerful staff. Very satisfied
		- Vinh V√µ (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-06-28): The supermarket is very dirty and unhygienic, the stalls are littered with products that are not neatly arranged. The staff is very attitude towards customers, everything here is very run down, the supermarket is empty, the products are also very expensive compared to other places but in return the service attitude is very poor. I will not come back here again top worst supermarket top1 winmart

		- H√≤a L√¢m ƒê·ª©c (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-06-28): The cashier was angry at the cutting board I don't know who to be angry with but show my attitude towards the remaining customers. I don't know anything and suddenly encounter this situation.
		- Kim Ho√†ng Lan (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-09-28): Many goods ensure quality Enthusiastic staff Service is absolutely excellent

		- Nhu Nguyen (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): üòä First time going and last time going. The supermarket staff has such an attitude towards customers. I bought food at the foodzone counter and sat down for a bit. The girls gathered at the table and no one said anything. How about asking me to go sit somewhere else and help? Strange ‚Ä¶
		- Thao Hoang (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Cashier attitude 1* And the staff at the ready-to-eat food counter 2* Average 1.5* I was at Winmart Landmark at 9:15 pm and had a pretty boring experience. I completely understand that everyone is tired late at night, and so am I. But your attitude makes me really feel it's completely worth it when the entire supermarket gets 3* on Google :)))) I bought some food because it was late and I thought supermarket fast food would be convenient. When I bought it, I was not told by the staff that I had to pick up spoons and chopsticks from the food court. When I was able to walk to the cashier (it was far away, not near), the cashier asked me to turn back so there were spoons and chopsticks. I politely asked the cashier if I could ask someone to take it for me? Then you nonchalantly say there are no employees. Why didn't the food counter staff notify the customers from the beginning or ask them if they could get their spoons and chopsticks???? Or does Winmart assume that everyone knows for themselves????  1* is so worthy!
		- Nhi June (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-07-28): It's a big and famous sthi that opened in Vincom center. When I went to the food court, I saw all the employees, winmart employees, employees from all kinds of industries... everyone sat and lay down, customers wanted to sit and think, eat and drink. I feel embarrassed, I don't want to sit for long. It's too bad, the customer sitting right at the table eating, sitting right where the customer is sitting, is really impolite.
		- PHUC NGUYEN (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-09-28): Great shopping experience, diverse goods, enthusiastic consultants
		- L·∫°c An (B√© L·∫°c) (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): If heavy carts are not allowed to be pushed out, then remove the sign and put the cart area on the stairs near the motorbike tunnel. Customers buy a lot. When I pushed the car out, the security guard came to stop me and talked like a father. The cleaning staff stood there laughing. Something that hinders wealth.
		- Lam Tue (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Please give me a little comment. You should retrain the behavior of the staff from the security department to the staff. The security guard talks to guests like a father to the world. And the staff behind him smirked. At the beginning of the year, when I met the staff here, I felt so lost.
		- H√¢n Mai (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-09-28): An ideal shopping location, cheerful and enthusiastic staff
		- longdau longdaubac (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-05-28): The supermarket should adjust the warehouse staff, the warehouse staff speaks rudely like market people, is aggressive and wants to beat the delivery person.

reviews:
		- Scott Mayers (2.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Overall I like my Vinfast motorbike, but I‚Äôm very disappointed in the customer service. It‚Äôs been two months and I still don‚Äôt have a license plate. I got pulled aside by the police and they fined me for not having a license plate. I called the guy at Vinfast and he got angry with me for asking where my license plate is. Very disrespectful customer service.

		- Jack Krupen (3.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Small showroom Wont let test drive
		- Hien Ngo (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Incredibly terrible service from sales to after sales services.
		- S√°ng Nguy·ªÖn Minh (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): VIP
		- ƒê·ªó Ng·ªçc (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-09-28): The car display area is quite impressive, attracting quite a few visitorsüòçüëçThere are the latest electric car models located here. Very professional and every time I visit Landmark 81 I check in at this point. However, the suggestion is that there should be more staff on duty more often and help visitors see the car's parameters to help sell better. There are car models here, I don't know if they sell them?ü´¢ Because I asked for staff but didn't see any staff here, it's a small minus point for the display locationü§£
		- ph√∫ v√µ ƒë·∫∑ng xu√¢n (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): Great VF3 buying experience. Attentive staff - even though the delivery wait was a bit long, I still rate Vinfast Landmark 81's customer service as 5 stars.
		- T√∫ Nguy·ªÖn (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): Business is nonsense and chaos. Received deposit but always had reasons for not having the car over and over again, missed appointments with customers more than 10 times, when customers asked to refund the deposit, they refused to return the deposit to the customer, attitude towards customers. Loss of reputation, loss of customer trust. Requesting a refund of the deposit must wait 30 or 45 days. The customer writes a request for a refund and says "I will submit this application, but after 30 days the answer will only be 1" which means NO REFUND OF THE DEPOSIT. brazen robbery and appropriation of customer property. Everyone get out of the way. Getting involved is just a waste of time and effort. Both management and sales are rotten
		- Trung Tr·ª±c BDS ƒê·ª©c H√≤a Long An (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): Services of large corporations are in disarray and have no system at all. Selling a car is worse than buying a bunch of vegetables at the market, when buying a car, never deposit money to pioneer, when selling tigers, the onions are overturned...
		- NGUYEN HOANG PHU (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Modern showroom, many car models on display, and a warehouse of many colored cars to choose from. Up to 99% will drop money ü•∞ ‚Ä¶

		- Tu·∫•n L√™ (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): May 26, 2023 at 10:45 am, transaction room number 2 requested to relearn how to work to better support customers. She confirmed 100% that it was not possible to edit the wrong ID (asked 3 times and she confirmed so I walked out). But when I went to another room, 15 minutes of support was done. This 1 star is for you
		- H√¢n V√µ (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Today, April 27, 2023, I went to the bank around 1-2pm. I don't know if it was because my car was broken or because I was wearing a student uniform that the security guards who kept the car were upset with me. He didn't even give me a parking ticket, forced me to put the car aside and frowned at me, annoyed that I didn't park it right away as he wanted. To be honest, the place on that side was very tight and I had used all my strength, but he didn't help me, which made me feel uncomfortable. My first impression was really not good when I entered the bank. Although the bank employees were very cute, my day was also very bad because of parking.
