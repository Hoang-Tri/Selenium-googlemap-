If you just want to come drink coffee, there is a small play area for children at the shop for free. You don't have to come to drink coffee and play in Puka land for free.\nEvaluation of food and drinks is very normal, prices compared to this quality are quite expensive.\nI ordered 1 fried bread, and the product I received was 2 fried eggs, 3 pieces of cucumber and 1 loaf of bread, price 29k.\nThe drink I call iced yogurt is normal, usually when I make yogurt at home I add condensed milk, a little sugar and squeeze in a slice of lemon. Here, it's simply a pot of yogurt poured in with ice on top and a straw added\nIn general, I just came to experience, have no intention of coming back, and you who come here should check the price and consider before coming.",
