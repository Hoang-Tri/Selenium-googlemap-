But I feel like this is not right. From the beginning of July until now, I have visited the restaurant twice in the morning, and both times there were 2 older women entering the restaurant to ask customers for money (begging style). One time on Sunday morning (July 14), a woman about 50-60 years old came to each table, cried, begged, asked for money from each table. Just 2 days later, today (July 16), another girl of the same age also stopped by each table, tilting her hat and asking customers for money. I found it a bit strange because the shop was located in a closed space but those people opened the door very naturally. I saw some people selling lottery tickets not even daring to go in. I don't understand how beggars can come in and out so naturally. I noticed that the staff also felt strange, so I thought about inviting those two girls out, but maybe they were shy. The restaurant should tell the staff to be tough with people like that (because I know they are just taking advantage of kindness, maybe the students who are tempted to give money will be poorer than those girls). I have a small suggestion, the shop can post a sign \"Lottery ticket sellers, please do not enter the shop\" at the door to prevent this situation. Sincerely give your feedback!",

Because I find the restaurant's toilet aesthetic \"very disgusting\" and \"very disgusting\" because of the strong smell. After a while, about 2 hours later, when I went back to the toilet, it was still the same as the picture. So I went home because I didn't dare wash my face to stay awake when I saw that. I would like to correct this, \"it's not the shop's fault\", it's because someone \"wasn't aware\" of the sink for vomiting and the sink for washing hands!

What catches the eye is a quite impressive and eye-catching mural. Stepping inside, you will be quite surprised because the decoration is classic with flower pots placed on shelves quite harmoniously. Modern with beautiful ceiling chandeliers. The shop has a parking attendant so it's quite neat. The service staff is also quite enthusiastic. However, it is not very professional. Drinks are also common and not special. The minus point and dissatisfaction is that the restaurant's nameplate is quite sketchy. The only view point of the restaurant is the balcony, which has not been given much attention......",

The music is also quite arbitrary, mainly following trends, so I give this place a pretty good score.\nThe price range is average, I ordered a glass of milk coffee for 24,000 VND.\nIn terms of overall quality and price, it's not quite 5* but it's still ok so I vote to encourage it.",

I can wait until 40 minutes and still not have two drinks even though the people who came in later, I have to say that in front of me I see 5 or 6 people coming in a long time after me and still have water? If I don't mention it, I don't have a product. I have no opinion. I feel like sitting there for 40 minutes and no one cares? The cashier told the barista that \"these two glasses are a bit long gone\" but she still hasn't arrived after waiting for someone to pick them up and bring them back? Decided to throw away 2 glasses of water and will never come back because the service is so bad. Even if the restaurant finds that the customer's 2 glasses of water are not worth much, they should reconsider their way of doing things.",

When I came back to pick it up, you said YOU'RE HAVING YOUR MONEY HABIT, then you said \"WHY DON'T YOU REMIND ME\", so it was the customer's fault for not reminding you of your money habit. You say that when you haven't checked yet :))) I asked to check the cam, but the guy asked me or something, then said nothing and then gave me the money back.

The most prominent feature of that restaurant is the unique staircase architecture, completely above, so guests can enjoy the dishes, sip a cup of coffee, watch the romantic scenery  from the stairs.  Month only up to 2 people.  On weekends or evenings, the restaurant has been burning tables even though the campus is quite large.  The shop is designed in the classic style of Western elegant and cozy with Asian style.  Besides, the furniture is cleverly arranged to create a suitable space for you to chat.  This is a cool, cool and airy area.  Staff are cute and enthusiastic.  Mid-range food and drink.  I have taken more menus.
