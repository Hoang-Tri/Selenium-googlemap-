Larger boats cost 100,000 VND per person and carry up to 20 people, but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre worth it. To get a good deal, arrive at the port by 4:50 AM. The trip to Cai Rang floating market takes about 50 minutes by boat. Well, if you come to Can Tho you should definitely try it but please do not overpay for it.\n\nCai Rang, however, feels overhyped. It‚Äôs not the bustling market with hundreds of small boats as often depicted. Instead, it‚Äôs mostly tourist barges with just a few local boats, and there‚Äôs little genuine commerce happening. You‚Äôll find one boat selling coffee, another offering noodles, and a couple of floating restaurants. We stopped at a staged rice paper factory and at the shops aimed at selling souvenirs. Unfortunately, the water is also heavily polluted with garbage, which takes away from the experience.",

Sadly, the ride was short of good, and the food was mediocre at best.\n\nBoat ride: With the expectation of a moving boat accompanying sights and views of the river, you only get about 5 minutes of the boat going. Then the boat makes a slow rotation and your headed back to base.\n\nMusic on the boat was ok. Was not the best as it only included traditional music.\n\nFood: Orders of food was pricey. Even the sodas were pricey. The best deal you would get is ordering one of the hotpot. Anything else, don't say you weren't warned. But, to be fare, it's a tourist attraction. So pricey food is expected.\n\nOverall, this boat dinner affair isn't good. Many things can be improved. Many things can be possible, should the owners want it better to represent Vietnam.",

There are cruise ships on the river, the menu is a bit high (drinks 110k-140k, hotpot 3xx-400k...). After buying water, sitting on a chill cruise is fine.
