I thought this was strange at the time and after initially refusing, I did. My first few days were tough, I had no fridge and hardly any good working internet. Soon both were fixed which I was happy about but the customer service from the two people working was really, really strange. It was almost as if they wanted to see me struggle during the lockdown as much as possible. The rest of the hotel guests would all eat together but they would never let me, even though I am not good at cooking myself. In the second week I became ill as a mosquito bit me. Once again, the boy working there seemed very panicky about covid and began accusing me of having it because I said I'd been to hospital. I made it clear I did not have covid but he was relentless in his questions and unwilling to help me find treatment. As a result, I went back to the hospital and found out I had tested positive for Dengue. It was horrible having this fever, let alone in an environment where staff were not happy to help. It made me feel like a burden. While the female receptionist was rude, I think that was more of a language barrier and her not understanding me. The boy however, I believe was intentionally very rude on two occasions, once upon arrival and once when he found out I was will. As a result, this, alongside the mosquitos was the reason I left, even during a lockdown. Wouldn't recommend to any English person at all in the future.",

There was air conditioning. It's not bad for just sleeping, but I was personally disappointed with the towel issue.. Otherwise, it's fine. There are many places nearby that sell gum sweat (surprisingly good. Price is around 25k). There's a food market (similar to a street food stall) near the river on weekends. It's surprisingly delicious. Food delivery is available through Grab.

There's no more space. If you park on the sidewalk, the police will fine you and the security guard will have to pay it, so you don't accept it.\" The hospital said: you can go to another place to park the car and then walk over to drink, but they won't accept the car anymore???\n\nSince when does drinking coffee have to be like begging to get out of the car?\nWill not come back and will advise all acquaintances to give up Phuc Long",

Instead of announcing in advance that the table is sold out, we only sell it to take away, so as not to waste customers' time. The staff should have felt it was wrong to let customers wait for so long and then announce that the table was full, but if you just keep your face blank, it makes the customers even more upset. You pay for food and drink, you don't ask for it. But the prices of the chain stores are not cheap either! High price means high quality. Drinks also sometimes have bad dishes.

Shop staff should proactively ask customers for M/L size, don't automatically upsize for the sake of revenue.\n2/ My friend ordered a glass of milk tea with full toppings, the staff pressed +3 types of toppings for 20-25k each => so a glass cost 110-120k. When I looked at the bill and thought it was too much so I spoke up, the employee said he was afraid there would be too many toppings and he wouldn't be able to put in ice and water. You should proactively advise if you see that a customer's order is unusual or unreasonable, because in the end it still comes back to the quality of the drink experience at your store.",

Despite the pleasant ambiance and friendly service, the lack of adequate cooling made it a bit challenging to fully enjoy the experience.\n\nAs I sipped on my coffee, I couldn't help but notice the warmth in the air, which detracted from the overall comfort of the environment. Additionally, considering the price I paid for my drink, I had hoped for a more premium experience.\n\nWhile I understand that quality comes at a cost, and that it can be difficult to control temperatures in bustling caf√©s, I hoped for a cooler atmosphere to fully savor my drink without feeling like I was overpaying for it.",
