Ok, I happily sent it because that was the rule at that time. I remember I was wearing baggy pants, a hoodie, a crossbody bag, and a mask. and normal glasses, but as soon as I walked in, the staff standing there had a look of caution in their eyes\nWalking around and seeing that there was nothing to buy, I went out and took a bottle of water from the counter. At this time, the security guard still had a cautious look on me so I went to the counter and said politely to the counter staff, \"Hey, I got the bottle of water just now.\" I sent it \"she looked at me with disdain and said \"where did you put that water bottle, now go get it yourself\" sounds ridiculous. When I sent it, I put it in the middle of the table and happily asked her to put it away for me, then turned away immediately, how did I know? Where did she keep it? Does anyone know where it is? It's right behind the mini sign right in her hand\nBut she still tried to complain about not helping me, that's really bad. The staff was so friendly and good\nIn general, you probably look at me when I dress like a poor, ordinary, miserable person, like a criminal\nLotte is not at fault, the fault lies with the staff",
