You don't have to come to drink coffee and play in Puka land for free.\nEvaluation of food and drinks is very normal, prices compared to this quality are quite expensive.\nI ordered 1 fried bread, and the product I received was 2 fried eggs, 3 pieces of cucumber and 1 loaf of bread, price 29k.\nThe drink I call iced yogurt is normal, usually when I make yogurt at home I add condensed milk, a little sugar and squeeze in a slice of lemon.

My favorite is their broken rice with grilled pork. Rice is fragrant and buttery soft but not dry at all. The pork is tender and perfectly seasoned. My friend got the Saut√© shaky beef(b√≤ l√∫c l·∫Øc) and it was amazing. The beef is definitely fresh here. Service is top notch. They respond promptly and try very hard to give you what you need.

        "review": "From the outside, the shop has security guards and ok, covered parking.\nThe restaurant serves orders at the counter, behind a waiter, so it's comfortable and convenient.\nThe space, tables and chairs are also carefully invested so I quite like it. There are many electrical outlets arranged so people like me who often use laptops like this place very much.\nWc is at a relative level, temporarily okay.\nThe sound part is because the shop, besides people studying in groups or working like me, also has many people playing games so it's not very quiet. The music is also quite arbitrary, mainly following trends, so I give this place a pretty good score.\nThe price range is average, I ordered a glass of milk coffee for 24,000 VND.\nIn terms of overall quality and price, it's not quite 5* but it's still ok so I vote to encourage it.",

From the car attendant to the manager or whatever, he really cares about customers, proactively asks to help customers with their car, and the tea pot is always filled (sometimes you can ask the staff to fill it if he forgets). The restaurant's atmosphere is chill even when sitting in an air-conditioned room. The restaurant's background music is a piano without lyrics.
