The school's computer room is not really good and needs to improve the quality of computers. The school's computers are too slow to serve learning.\n3. The paper-based final exam should be replaced with the school's computer-based exam to ensure early scores for students.\n4.Buying coupons at the school canteen is very unnecessary and time consuming.\n5. School events should be held in a visible area, which could be the yard of building C instead of the yard of building E, out of sight and many times when going to school, you still don't know that an event is happening.\n6. The school's swimming pool is beautiful and clean, but it would be more convenient if there were shampoo, shower gel and wraps for students to buy.\n\nIn addition to the above problems, the rest is very good, the teachers are happy and friendly, the health institute is fully equipped with many modern equipment, if there is an additional canteen in the health building it would be better.\n\nThe above comments are based on the experience of having studied at Vinh Long Technical Pedagogical School and currently studying at Nam Can Tho School to comment.",
