The drink is not very sharp, the peach tea is a bit sweet. The shop should check the more trendy way of mixing water.

Every time the service is quite good, especially today at the Pham branch in the forest, I met a staff member ordering water with a bad attitude. Even though we joked around with each other a few times when ordering, but it wasn't related to her, she still showed an unpleasant attitude (we still ordered drinks for her, very bth). The guy refused to give us the bill with an expression like she didn't like the customer. Only when another staff member reminded us that she was ordering water for the customer did he start to press the bill. I hope Pham's team will try to fix your attitude so that the staff can be friendly with customers to bring a better experience in the future.",

I said my friend had ordered Pham3 and I said it was weird, but the person said I had to order more or else there would be a surcharge of 30k for Pham. Any Pham side's oder drink is the same as any other, as long as you don't buy a drink. Other places are fine, but why do you guys say that? I don't know if you're joking or serious, but in my opinion, I'm not happy or satisfied. And the room is cold, so I said why isn't it cold? Then you change the number of guests in and out. The door is closed so it's not cold. I don't understand. I drank at Pham1's house from the time it opened until the branch opened. All the staff were always happy and cute.
