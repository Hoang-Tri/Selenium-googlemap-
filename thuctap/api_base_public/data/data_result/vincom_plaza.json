PM and include 1 corn and 1 drink (I told the Staff the same thing); At first, you also asked us if eating corn tasted like anything. I also told you that I ate regular corn (EMPLOYED THAT FROM THE FIRST I SAID REGULAR CORN), then I looked at the order screen and it showed 1. What kind of COMBO (COMBO with a picture of this and that costs 200 or so) and she said 1 corn of cheese? I told my friend that I would only take 1 regular coke and 1 regular corn. At this time, when he received the order, he continued to press another COMBO (140 or 160, I don't remember), so I asked again. The friend asked again: \"Sister, how much is 1 corn and 1 drink?\", she answered me \"122k\", then she clicked on the screen which combo is 109k with 1 snack package as shown in the picture (while just now you answered me it was 122k? üòá), at this point I was also very upset and didn't want to talk anymore so I accepted the payment and went to the theater to watch the movie because it was almost there. now. At first, I just thought it was because of work that you had to be like that, so from the beginning, when I wasn't asked by the staff first and automatically pressed the combo in a drink cup of this or that shape, I didn't say anything and asked my friend. give me 1 regular popcorn but 5 times 7 times you force me into another combo and even deliberately give me cheese popcorn when from the beginning I said to use regular flavor?\n- I know that the company also has requirements and you are all carefully trained to push these Extra Combos, but this will be something that makes customers very unhappy, because they feel they are not respected. , deceiving customers and also a contemptuous attitude toward customers. I also work in the F&B industry and I also know what it's like to run a service. If the company wants to promote sales, instead of intentionally forcing customers like that, they should use another strategy to call customers, not force them to work. Employees must run KPIs every day like that.\n- My experience yesterday was very unsatisfactory. I hope the theater will contact us to resolve it and receive a satisfactory apology. I love going to the movies but have never felt so uncomfortable!!!",

My wife and I asked where the online corn and drink stall was, but the staff glanced at me and gave us some kind of attitude, as if we were bothering them :)) when they were just asking a question, but the customer was very polite, and it was empty at that time, it wasn't crowded so why bother? I didn't say anything, I'm so angry that people still have that kind of attitude, I don't know what kind of crowd it is, why? The salary is also paid by the customer to work as a mother. Those of you who rated 5 stars must have been the staff in the theater :). I don't know if I should work as an employee or become a parent.

The second time was before printing the bill, I looked at the screen and said \"I'll take 1 corn, 1 regular drink, not combo\" because there was still a combo on the screen and you said \"yes\" and I changed it back. When the bill came out, you read it back to me but it was a combo so I told you to go alone so you said it was 1 corn, 1 drink and you said \"the combo price is still the same as the regular price\" but I insisted on just 1 corn, 1 drink\" you still didn't change it for me. I already know that you close sales to increase sales, but I don't like that attitude because I lie to customers and money counts more, so I hope CGV XUAN KHANH can review the way it serves customers.\n#CGV\n#CGVVincomXuanKhanh\n#CanTho",

At first, I thought I had finished watching the movie. But when I finished watching and asked the staff, the staff said it was all gone, but at that time I went in first and didn't have a POS while the person who came in later to watch the show and sat near me had one. I didn't understand and I went out to ask the staff why the other guy came in after me and had a POS that I didn't have. What's the strange business? At first, on the table, I saw a lot of POS showing at 11:50, but the staff didn't give it to me, only 3 copies. So what's wrong? Where is my post? I went out to ask again and they said everything. Meanwhile, everyone has a post but I don't. Why is that? I'm the one who came in quite early. Before the movie started, I went in but didn't have time to come out so I told them all. Then the staff at first didn't give me the post. I asked the manager of cgv to immediately reprimand the ticket counter staff for my mistake. At first I didn't want to be scandalized, but because the staff made me so angry, that's why it happened. out this incident!",

While giving him the bill, he said he met the conditions, but still took the money.\nIt's probably the customer's fault for not reminding the staff.

Supermarkets are easy to find because there are many signs and advertisements along the streets.\n- The supermarket inside is very large and has many floors. It's very cool inside. Before, I exercised at the park or came here to go to the toilet. The toilet was very clean, always fragrant and shiny.\n- Most visitors to the supermarket do not go shopping but mainly come here to use services such as eating, watching movies, having fun... BECAUSE here, in my opinion, they sell high quality goods. So the price is very high so there are not many customers.\n- The quality of service here is excellent from the security guards, cleaning staff to service staff, all do their jobs very well, are happy and enthusiastic, I am very satisfied with their service. supermarket employee.",

The restaurant's dishes are diverse, the line counter has many dishes, always changing so everyone can enjoy. In particular, there are many delicious dipping sauces for everyone to choose from. There are not many grilled dishes, but the quality is good, the meat marinade is rich in flavor, and the meat is fresh and delicious.\nThe hot pot is seasoned to taste, the topping is a bit small (you can order more).\nThe dining area is clean and airy.\nSecond. The service staff is quick, cute, and enthusiastic with customers. Always care, smile at customers, ask customers what to use to prepare dishes continuously.\nThe manager is also enthusiastic and cute, often chatting with customers to ask how they feel about the food. Is it true that the manager is a bit fat and ugly?

And that's the best thing left at Grill&Cheer Xuan Khanh.\nThe waiter brought up the dish extremely boringly, ordered 2 pieces of beef at a time, introduced it as whole pieces of leaf squid and brought it up, oh my gosh, when I asked for shrimp, the waiter said it was defrosting... wait for the customer to come in. What's the point of eating it fresh from defrosting? Ok, I'll wait for you guys to defrost...30 minutes later he said he was OUT OF SHRIMP. Tensions rose from here, the manager explained \"it's because the waiters are not familiar with the kitchen\" - so is it the kitchen's fault, the staff's or whose fault???. The extremely negative and superficial explanation comes from his position as manager. I was bored and didn't want to talk so I asked to check even though I hadn't eaten the desert yet. The manager tried to offer 1 ticket off but I didn't agree and when the bill came out...3 tickets (but that's a lot) Forced to rate!",
