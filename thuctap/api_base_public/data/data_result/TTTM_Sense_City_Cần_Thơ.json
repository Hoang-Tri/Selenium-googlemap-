It is not too sweat so the children can enjoy it. The menu has few of choices, therefore the customer just can choose among 6 - 8 options. The special one, mango cream with steamed glutinous rice, is usually out of order. The staff is nice and well-trained üëçüëçüëç",

From the time of Tan An school, Coopmart was built and then expanded into Sense city.\n‚úÖ Convenient location, right in the city center.\n‚úÖ There is parking above and below the basement.\n‚úÖ Coop supermarket's prices are quite good and there is a truck to bring the goods back if you buy enough of the bill (200,000 should be). Points included.\n‚úÖ The food is because I've been working far away for 7 years. Sometimes when I come back, I eat company pizza, sometimes eat King BBQ, and sometimes eat Lotte, I see a variety of food brands. Comfortable, spacious seating\n‚ùåHowever, I have additional comments because the children's game area upstairs is quite small. It seemed like there was one before but it was eliminated. There's no one on duty for the games outside, so if you want to buy a card, go to the children's play area that sells tickets there and buy it (Tet 2024). I think the center is quite large so it brings more fun games for children, making it more convenient for families.\n‚ùóÔ∏èIn addition, the parking lot here is only for customers using the center's services, which is completely reasonable. Avoid foreign customers sending you nothing. But at 10:00 p.m. supermarkets and shops close, except for movie theaters that are open. However, I watched the show until nearly 12:00 pm on March 7, 2024. I forgot to put the movie ticket in the trash and had to pay 5 thousand. Ok, 5 or 10 thousand to park the car is no problem, but when guests come in and out at almost 12 o'clock at night and don't watch a movie, what are they doing there? All the doors are closed and having to collect movie tickets to believe it is a bit unreasonable, while guests go down by elevator straight to the basement. In case outside customers come in to send in for free, they come in from outside, they can't go through the inside route and they can't come out at the same time as the movie ends üòÖüòÖ\nSo if this is done well, you should let the security guards take the time of the last slot that day, to avoid charging them extra parking fees.\n\nHope Sense city will develop strongly and provide better service in the future ‚ù§Ô∏è",

Oltr 1 cup of noodles has a price difference of up to 2k2, not only omachi, hoon hoc or other dishes also have a big difference.\nFurthermore, the parking attendant still had a very good attitude. The first time I came here because I couldn't choose the dish I wanted and was charged parking fees, so that's ok. The second time I came to buy things, I still asked her to give me 2k. When I asked the teacher if I was buying anything, the goods were packed in the car, she said when I bought the goods I would give her a receipt, not if she saw the bundle and didn't collect money! Hello? So why didn't you ask for a bill in the first place instead of asking for 2k? You have to say your rules, but if you don't tell them, how will we know?\nIn general, the collection of parking fees is not friendly and is also expensive, so I don't dare to visit.",
