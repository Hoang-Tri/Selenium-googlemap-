But don't worry, just walk around and you'll meet new friends - because this place is famous for its friendly spirit of exchange.\n\nThe lecturers here are quite enthusiastic, sometimes so \"hot\" that you have to applaud their \"super\" communication ability, but if you happen to be late, don't forget to prepare yourself mentally, because their \"enthusiasm\" sometimes even surpasses the limits of the subject! And in terms of facilities, the school may not be too luxurious, but you will always find a cozy study corner, or at least a seat enough to \"rest\" while studying.\n\nCan Tho University is a place where you can both \"bury your head\" in books and enjoy moments of Western-style relaxation.",
