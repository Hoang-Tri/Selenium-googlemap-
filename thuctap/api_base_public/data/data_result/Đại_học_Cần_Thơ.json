Trash is everywhere around the campus (obviously nobody is teaching the students anything to change this behavior) security guards are aggressive and racist, very poor offer to eat anything or even have a decent cup of coffee. Disappointing to see considering it's been running for 60years and it is going backwards in development.",

The special thing is, if you walk through the campus, you will understand what \"studying hard\" means when you have to try not to get lost in the vast campus like a maze. But don't worry, just walk around and you'll meet new friends - because this place is famous for its friendly spirit of exchange.\n\nThe lecturers here are quite enthusiastic, sometimes so \"hot\" that you have to applaud their \"super\" communication ability, but if you happen to be late, don't forget to prepare yourself mentally, because their \"enthusiasm\" sometimes even surpasses the limits of the subject! And in terms of facilities, the school may not be too luxurious, but you will always find a cozy study corner, or at least a seat enough to \"rest\" while studying.\n\nCan Tho University is a place where you can both \"bury your head\" in books and enjoy moments of Western-style relaxation.",

Area 1 is located on Ly Tu Trong street, area 3 in Hoa An and a new area in Mang Den.\n\nThe school offers multi-disciplinary training but the strongest is Agriculture and Fisheries with huge investment.
