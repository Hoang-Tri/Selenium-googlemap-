The ground floor and first floor are always crowded, mostly young people, the ground floor is a bit noisier than the first floor.\nThe layout style of the floors is quite similar with 2 main colors, however the 2nd and 3rd floors are decorated in a more Zen style and are completely quiet, probably well soundproofed so they are completely separate from the world. Outside, the decoration is very elegant and polite, it is the only place where smoking is allowed, and is equipped with a deodorizer so even though the space is closed, it does not smell bad and does not affect the next table.

At first I didn't pay attention, but when I finished my first drink, when I printed out the bill, I saw it was 289 points. A while later, my friend came over so I ordered 2 more portions of beef rice and 1 cup of coffee. When I paid, I didn't pay attention to the points, but when I got home, I saw that there were 284 points left. The next time I drink coffee, it's still 280. I wonder if the shops will tell me to contact IT. My next drinking spot is 3/2, DBP, CMT8, LTK. So my score goes up, but it's like if I drink at that place regularly 2 or 3 times, my score goes down again. Most recently, my score went back up to 292 points, but on the 28th or 29th, when I drank coffee at 5:00 p.m. at Ly T. Kiet's restaurant, my score was deducted again to 288 points (this score is a promotion score, not a deduction when pay). Or Trung Nguyen changed its policy of not wanting to promote Platinum status or there were negative problems in Trung Nguyen's franchised coffee shops. Please ask Trung Nguyen to review my case. If you want evidence, please contact me for specific work. I also wondered about this at 3/2 and DBP shops but it still didn't work.

Because me and my friends are in District 10. I got married to GV, so every night when I go on dates with friends, I choose TN HVT in the middle, so this shop is so familiar. Until one of her friends hunted for something and occasionally got a discount code. Every time I use a discount code, it means the service is poor. Normally for glass cups and crockery cups, there is a discount code for portable plastic S size cups to take away even if customers are already seated at the table. While going to other TN Legend at the Airport or District 10, they are still served in glass or ceramic cups. I'm allergic to coffee made from plastic cups. It loses the delicious taste of coffee. Sometimes there are discount codes, but that kind of service is really \"disrespecting customers\". I think the restaurant should change this service style. Now my friends don't want to go to this restaurant anymore. Normally there is no discount code, so I happily order a portion of Rumi Cafe for 129k. Don't look down on customers holding discount codes. Discourage this point.\nIt's lovely to have Mr. NV keep the car.",

However, after yesterday, I decided not to visit Trung Nguyen anymore for several reasons:\n- The security guard was not enthusiastic about arranging a car for the customer. When he left to pick up the car, he only came to pick up the ticket while his eyes were still focused on the phone screen playing games.\n- Trung Nguyen HVT has just had a change in service staff and the feeling is that Trung Nguyen no longer really cares about staff training. When guests came in, there was no greeting even though my companion and I politely said \"hello\". When going to the 2nd floor, it was no exception, the staff did not greet guests at all.\n- When ordering, they didn't say anything, didn't confirm what the customer ordered, and didn't even say yes\n- Actually, the image of the employee making a drink while mouthing something is very offensive. The male waiter on the 2nd floor yesterday left me with a very bad impression about that.\n- Normally when I leave, I always receive thanks from the staff. I was even very impressed with the cashier girl on the first floor a while ago because of her friendliness. But nowadays, employees hardly know how to say thank you\nMaybe I'm picky myself, but if I work on service, I think it's better to have perfection to create a good impression on customers.",

I asked the staff to turn down the heat to make it cooler, but the staff said the air conditioner couldn't be adjusted. This is funny.\n3. My coffee taste level is not high, so drinking a 50k cup of coffee doesn't feel any different from other shops. The price is high compared to other brand shops such as: Cop Phe Hao, Twice... only 30k. The green tea and jelly are only average, and the prices are still higher than other shops. In short, the price is high, the taste is nothing better.\n4. The service staff is normal, not as welcoming and cheerful as other branded shops. There is a separate ground floor for gentlemen to smoke, another point of difference. There were books to win people's hearts and encourage learning on each guest's table, but I noticed that no one had them in their hands.",

At 8:30 a.m., the air conditioner on the 3rd floor doesn't turn on. According to the staff, there will be service staff on the 3rd floor at 9:00 am. I discussed that I don't need service, I just need to turn on the air conditioner for me and the staff agreed but they still didn't open it, it felt like They are very indifferent to customers. If they don't agree, just talk frankly with the customer, you can't say one thing and do another like that.\n3. Wifi on the 3rd floor is extremely slow and almost impossible to access.\n\nIn my opinion, if you pay a higher price to go to Trung Nguyen, the amenities they bring must be better. It's a pity that I was in such a hurry that I didn't remember to take photos so everyone could have a more intuitive view before deciding whether to enter the 3rd floor of Trung Nguyen Hoang Van Thu or not!",

However, after the restaurant was upgraded, my experience completely changed in a negative direction.\nDisappointing points:\n* Price hike: The price of a single egg shumai sandwich has increased to 66,000 VND, a price too high compared to the quality received.\n* Food quality has decreased: The taste of egg shumai bread is no longer as good as before, far behind the Remax Coffee shop next door with a more affordable price (45,000 VND).\n* Noisy space: Using a lot of glass in the design makes the shop very noisy, especially when there are many customers. The chatter of groups of customers creates a bustling feeling like a market, losing the inherent quietness of a coffee shop.\n\n* Inadequate upgrades: Although the restaurant space is more beautiful and luxurious after the upgrade, these changes cannot compensate for the decrease in food quality and increase in prices.\n\nConclude:\nWith the current price and quality of food like that, I will never return to Trung Nguyen Coffee - Remax again. I feel disappointed by this negative change.",

And I still get served as always, the atmosphere and decoration of the restaurant have been upgraded very beautifully!!!\nBut when the iced tea was brought out, everything beautiful in my eyes was Shattered!!!! The iced tea has a very disgusting taste!!! It smells of tobacco, very strong, I don't believe that a reputable cafe like Trung Nguyen would use such disgusting iced tea to invite customers to drink... It didn't stop there, I drank a cotton ball the size of a cigarette filter. I still didn't believe this was a cigarette filter, so I showed it to the barista. They didn't explain and didn't apologize for the cotton ball, and just said that the tea smelled similar to cigarettes, because I couldn't remember what kind of tea we were using. And I asked for a new glass of iced tea, but it still smelled like cigarettes, very disgusting!!!\nAfter returning home, I recalled the incident. I deduced that a cigarette had been dropped in that batch of tea, cooked, and given to customers to drink without the shop's carelessness.\nRight now I'm still having chills and vomiting from the horrible taste of that iced tea!!!\nThis is my own opinion, it may be right or wrong, but the cotton ball in the tea cup is very unusual.\nSincerely give your feedback so that the shop can fix it if it was accidentally dropped in, or if it's really due to the smell of that tea, please change to another type, because I'm sure no one can drink tea that smells 100% like tobacco!!!",

Everything seemed fine until I took the car out. Because I arrived at rush hour, I couldn't pull up to the curb in front of the restaurant to park my car. So I went around the bow of the ship to park my car at the back of the shop. At that time, I saw a number of motorbikes parked there. But it turned out it was a customer's car from the restaurant next door, and I don't understand why they were allowed to park their car on this side of the restaurant. And when I took my car out, I saw that my car was parked close to that shop's car, blocking the helmet I hung on the car. When I took the hat out, it was completely scratched like the photo below. The car was parked close to me and I had to struggle for a while to get it out. Why do other shops in Trung Nguyen's area leave their cars indiscriminately like that, leading to damage to customers' belongings and cars? If Trung Nguyen guests are not allowed to park there, there must be a warning sign to let guests know!",

Another Trung Nguyen Legend!\n- The restaurant space is extremely hot and sometimes the toilet smells bad! The whole shop has an air conditioner, but it's very old and not cool. It's so hot that you have to turn on the fan to drink, which is like torture! I don't think a big brand would leave a restaurant that old and hot like that, but the air conditioner is so old and black that it's not cold enough! This restaurant would rather be closed than leave it as it will lose its image! Not a single piece! After drinking, Beo and Nga said goodbye and won't go back! And they also don't want to go back to any Trung Nguyen shop to drink again! Someone went to the shop's Facebook page to talk about this and only looked at it and didn't respond to customers, which is really bad customer service! The shop staff's face is not happy either!",

Every night we go on a date to drink coffee, it's like we don't get to sleep until 2 or 3 in the morning. Hiuhiu. But it still has the taste of TN coffee and will support it for a long time. . Price: Ranging from 55-65k.  Location: Located on a one-way street, on the left side. It's a bit inconvenient because motorbike riders have to pay attention to crossing car lanes. Parking in the house next to the shop.. Space: large. Every time I come here there are no customers so it's very airy and comfortable. Play soft music, suitable for studying or working.",
