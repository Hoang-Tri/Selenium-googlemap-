As for the potatoes, they have bad luck, some are crispy and some are cold. The space is a bit small, but there is a dining floor above, the space is clean and has cool air conditioning. The price is moderate, in general quite expensive compared to popular dishes but at such a price the quality is ok and the price is ok and acceptable.
