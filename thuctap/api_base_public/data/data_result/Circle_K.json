I bought things and paid, everything would be normal. As soon as I turned away, the lady said \"there's a bank that's scary to open for a long time\" which was very annoying. Is it a problem if I buy something and it takes me so long to pay for it, when there aren't many customers or anything at that time?",

After making shared ice, I waited at the counter to pay for it so I could ice it together and didn't even bother calling it mine? Even if a bunch of customers yell at me, they won't be able to scream. Then, after heating up some cheese sausage or something, I can't remember the name, but after heating it, I put it under the barista's table - then I climbed in so I could get some. Then I put the Thai milk tea in the bag, and the ice part was told to be put in the bag of noodles and freshly heated sausage? So what do you do, father? Who dares to come back because he works as a service employee????",

I was not satisfied so I said I didn't need to accumulate (because I thought I would receive a gift according to the program, so no). After that, the staff did not say anything and let me calculate the bill. After calculating the bill, I wondered if I could not receive the rabbit. The staff said that if I don't accumulate membership points, I would not get a gift. Coming to Circle K because of the collab program with 7-color rabbits, I saw many big brands sponsoring it. Only the gifts are sponsored but I'm afraid customers won't be able to buy or sell anything else.",

As for the restroom, let me tell you whether or not you can use it. If I go in to buy, if I go up and my friend comes in later to buy, will it have any effect? I have to yell.

You should stop by for a walk around.\n- The store is located on Hai Ba Trung street, night market, food area. In a row, this store is the brightest and most prominent so it is very easy to find.\n- The store has quite a large staff, always cheerful and enthusiastic, and the service is also attentive.\n- The shop's space is quite small, only enough for about 5 people to shop, but it's packed, but there are enough products like other supermarkets. Especially food and beverages are complete. In addition, they also sell fast food including dumplings, egg noodles... they also serve drinks like coffee, something in English that I don't remember but I call it shaved ice :))\n- In addition, there is an area above where guests can bring food and drinks to enjoy. Upstairs, the space is more open, more comfortable, there are plenty of tables and chairs and the distance is just enough to be able to talk privately without affecting those around you. In my opinion, here you can sit and study quite reasonably and never fear hunger. There are chairs in front of the hallway to sit on, but it's quite hot here because the cars passing by make it very hot. There are days when there are a lot of moths gathering here, so I don't like sitting out here.",

When I consulted ctrinh and I asked how ctrinh was, but the attitude was very superficial, not even answering my question.\nThe last problem was that I bought milk tea at the counter, the staff informed me that the type I needed was out of stock, so I temporarily bought a cup of original oolong milk tea. But the result the staff brought out was that the milk tea was poured into a glass from the available bottled milk tea and they arbitrarily added an ice remover for me (is this what I need?). What I want to reflect here is that the staff's way of answering and asking questions is not clear, and they joke around when customers first enter until they leave. This needs to be reminded. Next time I will not use the service at this branch again, thank you for the service.",

They welcomed me but continued to stand and talk to each other (content saying bad things about other employees and not caring whether other people heard or not). Are not). After handing out the bill, the male friend kept the bill and told me to go to the counter to receive the food, while the female friend prepared the food and looked at me like where was the bill with an unpleasant attitude until the male friend saw that and said he was keeping the bill???\n\nSecond time: still a male and female couple (not the two employees above). One person went into the warehouse to check the goods, and the other person stood outside to calculate the bill, but for some reason, I called out to her 3 times before the person at the counter finally looked at me. When I finished reading the order, I couldn't concentrate. I kept listening and paying attention to other things, making me reread the order 3 or 4 times. After asking a lot of questions, after making the food, the order was still wrong (even though the store was empty at that time and I was the only one ordering food).\n\nA large chain store whose employees are so unprofessional!",
