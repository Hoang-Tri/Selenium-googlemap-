Showed up on a Thursday at 1 PM and paid entry fee (after having to get attendant's attention who was busy texting / playing games on his phone), took off shoes and ascended stairs. Displays full of items but unmarked. Skipped the recorded commentary based on poor reviews. Wifii not working. Air was stuffy--ceiling fans were turned off for some reason. Not sure if the cafe was running--no evidence of food/drink service for visitors and none offered. Disappointed that the lithotherapy objects were removed from the collection. As a Viet Kieu who is an avid tarot person, I found myself a bit let down. Three stars for a cool collection of items that photographed well but it all felt a bit neglected and randomly displayed--bummed that they did not offer Vietnamese tarot decks for sale.",

There is a huge collection of tarot cards from all around the world, and covering the whole history of tarot from the mid-18th century up to today. Dr Ngo, who teaches comparative religions and beliefs at the university here, had me riveted by his explanation of the history of tarot, and its connections with art and religions in the last 200 years. I highly recommend it, together with the very pleasant coffee shop on the ground floor.",

It‚Äôs 200k vnd per person and they give you a guide that is not good at all. The guide is a website on your cellphone, pretty hard to use and it just give you some date about when this kind of tarot was made and what pictures are on it. The price include a drink that is a small bottle of water and a ‚Äúgift‚Äù that was a used vampire tarot pack...\nDefinitely not worth it.

Everything is well laid out so that Dr. NGO can walk you through the history of the cards for both ludic/paidic purposes as well as the more mystical side. The tour focuses mainly on the history of the mystic, looking at it from all different cultural and religious view points. Finally, it extends beyond the tarot to a many more relics. Amazing tour in a beautifully restored building. Dr. NGO is knowledgeable and respectful of the history and culture. This museum is a must if you are in the city even for a short amount of time. Be sure to email a bit ahead of time to arrange for your visit.",
