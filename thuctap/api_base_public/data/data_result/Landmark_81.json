I ordered ice milk filter, cookie ice cream and cape ice cream. When I received the dish, I was quite surprised that it did not look like the illustration. As for the ice cream, I rated the cookie ice cream as the best, while the cape ice cream looked like soup ice cream and was not very delicious. I recommend everyone to use cookie ice cream when coming to the Highlands. Even though it's quite crowded, the food still comes out very quickly.",

I paid with a Napas card but the seller didn't get a 20k discount according to the program offered. I agree that 20k is not much, but when I asked, the staff said that if the customer wants a discount, they must tell the staff in advance???? Since when do customers have to remind customers about incentives offered by the brand itself???? I'd rather forget what you said to me, then I can sympathize, but the way you said it made me find it funny =))) My order was quite large so I asked the support staff to help carry it out for me. Even though the restaurant was quite empty, you refused to bring it to the table for us, causing us to struggle for a few minutes. We ordered 2 cups of peach jelly tea, 1 cup without sugar. When giving us water, the staff didn't tell us which glass was available and which one wasn't, so we had to try it to find out. At a HL restaurant in a large shopping mall, the service quality made me quite disappointed. Hope to receive an answer about this incident and also hope the brand shows a fix in the near future.",

I ordered the promo sushi set, which featured a delightful combination of shrimp, salmon, and squid for only VND 99,000. The sushi was incredibly fresh, with each piece well-prepared and flavorful. Despite being a budget-friendly option, the quality exceeded expectations, making it a fantastic deal.\n\nAdditionally, I tried the surimi king crab meat for just VND 59,000, and it was equally satisfying. The texture and flavor were spot on, proving that affordability doesn‚Äôt have to compromise taste or quality.\n\nThe overall experience was a pleasant surprise‚Äîgreat sushi at such reasonable prices in a prime location. Whether you‚Äôre a sushi lover or just looking for a light, fresh meal that doesn‚Äôt break the bank, Nakajima Suisan is worth checking out!",

The general feeling is that the restaurant has a pretty good space, not too cramped but not really spacious either. Service staff is enthusiastic but sometimes slow due to the restaurant being crowded.\n\nRegarding food, some dishes are quite delicious, especially grilled dishes and hot pots, but some dishes are not prepared evenly, some are a bit salty or oily. The price is okay compared to the general level, not too expensive but not really cheap either.\n\nThe minus point is that it takes quite a long time to prepare the dish, especially when the restaurant is crowded. Besides, the surrounding area is a bit noisy, making it difficult to have a comfortable conversation. Overall, this is a popular pub, suitable for gathering friends, but if you want to experience better service, you can consider other options.",

The shop is located in a quite convenient location and the biggest plus is the view overlooking Landmark 81, especially in the evening, the view is also OK. But remember, going to Nguyen Huu Canh street at night will be quite congested.\n\nExperience details:\n* Food: I ordered the main dish which is roasted goose with garlic, but I didn't find the unique taste. The food is presented quite attractively and the quantity is just enough for 2 people. The taste of the dish, in my opinion, is pleasant and suitable for general taste. However, a small minus point is that the goose meat is a bit dry. If it was cooked softer, it would be perfect. In addition, the restaurant also has many other dishes on the menu, with a variety of choices.\n* Service: Service staff is quick and enthusiastic. They are always on hand to support customers. The parking attendant was also very friendly and cheerful, creating a good impression right from the start.\n* Price: The price on Hang Ngan Street, in my opinion, is quite reasonable, suitable for the budget. With the number of dishes I ordered, the final bill was not too high. Because I ordered a bit more than I could eat, I had to pack a portion to take home. This also shows that the restaurant is quite generous with the amount of food.\n* Space: The restaurant space is quite airy and clean. View of Landmark 81 from the restaurant is a big plus, especially in the evening when the building lights up. However, because the restaurant is pub-style, there are quite a few staff standing around. This may make some diners feel a bit \"overwhelmed\"\n\nIn general, if you're looking for a budget friendly option, if you've tried the bong, I think it's okay to come here.",

The goose meat is soft, sweet, mixed with a strong garlic flavor, served with raw vegetables and sweet and sour dipping sauce for a wonderful flavor.\n- Braised goose with alligator: The sour taste of alligator mixed with the fatty taste of goose meat creates a unique flavor, stimulating the taste buds. Braised duck with crocodile is served with vermicelli and raw vegetables.\n- La Vong fish cake: Fragrant grilled fish cake, served with vermicelli, herbs, roasted peanuts and shrimp paste mixed with lemon and chili.\n\n- Price: Reasonable\n- Service: Fast, enthusiastic\n- Space: Spacious, airy, clean\n- The restaurant has spacious parking.",

So when eaten, it is very harmonious and pleasant. Scored 9/10.\n- The appetizer of tomatoes soaked in soy sauce is truly wow, with cold fresh tomatoes, soaked in soy sauce. I'm someone who doesn't like eating raw tomatoes, but I'm still very impressed with this taste creation.\n- Crab steamed with pepper wine is very special. You can ask the restaurant to remove it if the meal is not convenient to use by hand.\n- Steamed fish with homemade tofu layer is very special.\n- Fried rice with truffle mushrooms is very delicious.\n\n- Other items, I will review in each picture.",

When it came time to pay, I was charged 3 dishes (cucumber + pickles (a few pieces) + thin fried cake, a few slices but total 60k). Not worth much money but feels like being cheated, it would be better for the staff to tell the customer clearly from the beginning to know. I really hate this kind of service!\n\nAs for the food, I ordered it\n- Sweet and sour ribs => Ribs have very little meat, eating them feels like chewing crispy fried dough with sauce so the price is not suitable for the dish!\n- Char Siu noodles with water => eat normally",

This cinema has the biggest IMAX auditorium in Vietnam, the price is also the same for 2D showtime üëåüèª\n\nAfter the pandemic, I can say that CGV is losing its quality, cutting down so many priviledges and also no many staffs during peak hours. That also explains why we are having so many long queu in the hallway üòä\n\nTalking about quality, no other local cinemas can offer the same quality as CGV because they invest a lot of money to built their screen and seats, so the experience is always so different from other competitors. Once you are at CGV, you will never want to leave the brand for others ü§óü§óü§ó\n\nBut I have to admit that I am still very disatisfied with this gowngrade in service recently ü•π",

If  you are staying close to the theater in the Vinhome Central then you can just walk in with the ticket when the show is started or just before it.

My friend and I told him that we were applying the U22 program, and the staff also checked both of our citizenship identification cards. But when you click on our invoice, you still click on the price saying the program has not been applied yet, so I remind you that you just checked our citizenship IDs but If the U22 price has not been applied, after I told you, you had a very unfriendly attitude towards me, and then you said you forgot. I can accept that you are mistaken or forgot something, but your attitude is very annoying to the other person, especially if I am your customer. If you don't like using discount programs for customers, you can suggest to the company to eliminate this program. Don't have an attitude towards customers when people use these programs. discount program like that. While I went to other branches, the staff happily asked if we had U22, rather than waiting for us to \"ask\" and then have this attitude. When I bought the popcorn, I told you clearly that I was only getting 2 drinks for 1 corn, but you still arbitrarily clicked the premium combo for me, the difference in money was nothing but What bothers me here is the way it's so arbitrary and disrespectful to customers. I don't know if you guys run sales or something in the parts that sell popcorn or not (and if so, that's a problem with your offering skills to customers) but here it's the customers. Customers have made clear requests about what they need. If you want to offer another Combo that is different from the customer's request, at least you have to tell the customer it's like this, not just keep silent and automatically click and then receive the item. like that. And a few times in the past, I had a bad experience here. The staff, while placing an order for me, still turned around to talk to a few other staff members. I didn't know how urgent they were.

French fries were cold and coated in a horrible cheese dust most probably full of processed chemicals.\nSteak was cooked to order. And even though they are very small portions. The grill chef did know how to cook a steak. But the mushroom. And pepper sauce were very watery and did lack flavour and body.\nUnfortunately we Europeans do like are food hot. Unless we are eating salads... But the majority of the food was lukewarm which is not very pleasant at the best of times.\nIn the dessert department. They all looked very pretty and tempting. But unfortunately absolutely tasteless.. Tirosomo is surpose to be coffee flavoured... But there was no taste of coffee only a after taste of processed cream substitute.. Not pleasant at all.\nThe jelly's again looked beautiful. But had no taste or flavour.\nAnd for the price. We paid 540 dong per person. I don't think we woukd go again.\nService was good.. And are server definitely deserved a tip.. To which we gave her directly. Knowing that she woukd be able to keep it for herself....",

Depending on the delicious dish, the temporary dish depends on each person's taste.\n+ Seafood is a strong point, filled continuously, including grilled onions and cheese,....\n+ Beefsteak is ok, soft and not tough, everyone.\n+ Dimsum is also very good, kimsa dumplings and premium shrimp dumplings are super delicious\n+ Dessert line (yogurt, tea, panna cotta, ice cream, cakes,...) diverse, delicious, less sweet ice cream is good\n- Price: okay :))) Tickets are 10k cheaper than D'maris or something, but they don't have free drinks, a big minus. The food line is not diverse, the spices are also relatively good. The ticket price for me is 645k per person including ticket\n\nOverview: okay.
