When I go out, I meet the vin security guard. The vin security guard doesn't let me in. I ask him to go back to the front. When he turns around and asks the Highlands black-shirted store manager, he doesn't care. In general, he sees a 5-month pregnant woman who doesn't help him. :((, the staff's attitude is bad, at least say I'm very sorry, or find another place, but here after the pregnant woman turned around and came back without a word of shyness.",

For example: you are lost on street number 1, but you want to find your relative's house on street number 2, it is not easy. If you ask the people on street number 1, very few, extremely few people know where street number 2 is to show you. \n\nTo be frank: the people who numbered and named the streets in this Nam Long area, as well as the people who approved the street names here - they are irresponsible with their work, do business arbitrarily, are uncultured or to put it bluntly: they are uneducated. \n🍀🍀🍀\nBack to the coffee!\nThe coffee here is quite delicious. Reasonable prices. The staff are young - dedicated and polite (very active). There is an air-conditioned room upstairs but few people use it. The majority of coffee addicts sit downstairs with a pretty good ventilation system. \n👍They serve breakfast here: pho, steak and a few other dishes that I don't remember. I had pho here - but the pho was not delicious and could be said to be bad. I haven't eaten the other dishes so I don't know. I don't know if they serve food at noon and in the evening. \nIn short, this is a pretty good place to drink coffee. The frontage is long and hugs the corner of the street, so parking is the most comfortable, especially for Bikers. Wish you all good health and good luck 🍀",

I also came in to buy water, I accepted to pay for the damaged glass, so I am also a customer, but the staff still considered me a vandal and forced compensation.

When it comes to drinks, the Highlands system already has the standards. However, recently I feel like the restaurant's staff is having problems. They don't seem to respect customers, from not saying hello, taking the bill, giving them the bill and wait card, not saying thank you, and then when making drinks. The boss was waving tools very loudly, the guys were laughing and talking, sweeping the trash was not very subtle in front of the guests, the toilet was very dirty and the sink was clogged and no one cared.... I read it briefly from the female employee. His name is Nghi, his face is very cute but I can see the above attitudes from you. I care about space, so it's not because of the unpleasant things about the staff that I don't come here anymore, but I think it's a contribution so the shop owner can read and adjust his staff. All the collapse of business has human resources contributing the most, especially this service industry!",

I think the reason is not that people lost consciousness, but mainly the lack of clear separation of the shop. I find this very offensive.",

Poor service, staff on the evening shift on January 14, 2024 were superficial, there was a lucky draw program but no announcement. When the shop runs out of change, customers don't take the initiative to exchange it even when there aren't too many customers. The staff would rather refuse the order instead of sending someone to exchange money while the customers don't have any change. Customer Service is too poor compared to a big brand and the price is this high. As someone who loves Highland, I cannot accept it. When the restaurant staff saw new customers jumping in line, they didn't remind them and directly ordered them first even though they saw our group arriving before and waiting in line for a long time. The toilet is also dirty, tissues and trash are thrown everywhere and no one cleans it up. Everything is so bad, our group cannot accept it",

Then she looked so confused when I asked her to make us another 1. It took a really long time for them to get us the coffee so I ran across the street to get my own coffee in the middle of breakfast. Also, the food was mediocre. 1 time experience",

The two times I went were 5 or 6 years apart but the quality of the restaurant is still the same, from the decor. until the drink. Every corner of the restaurant in the photo is very beautiful, the drinks are a bit expensive but delicious. In general, after a while of going to self-ordering and bringing your own water, when you come here, the staff comes to the table to order and bring the water, showing that you don't like it at all. I don't know when I will visit the restaurant again, but I will definitely recommend my friends and acquaintances to come here to experience it, the restaurant is really impressive. Well, if you want to live a virtual life, you should go early in the morning or in the afternoon with light sunshine for better photos. I took this photo around 3 or 4 pm.",

They just sit and talk while the children run around screaming loudly. One time the children played with paper airplanes and hit me in the head. Neither the parents nor the staff had any supervision over the children. And today is the weekend, wanting to enjoy the weekend, these loudspeakers scream and run loudly around the shop. I strongly recommend that the management tell the staff to remind families with young children not to let their children scream and run around like that, it will greatly affect the experience of everyone around them. Entering Highland and accepting higher water prices than other places means wanting to exchange for the best experience and space. Today I couldn't sit for more than 1 hour because the children kept screaming and it hurt my ears and head, and the staff continued to act normally without reminding me. As for the parents, there's no need to talk...just sit there and chat no matter who's upset 🙂\nWe hope that Highland's superiors will note this situation and take measures to remind parents to manage their children so as not to affect everyone's experience at Highland.",

After arriving at the parking lot, the car started to park and there was no sign of instructions on where to park the car. Once parked, the staff asked to move the car but did not come out to see or give instructions on where to park. At first, they told me to park the car at the gas station. Then they told me to park on the sidewalk, after parking, they were forced to move again, had to move to the other side of the street. Is it still fun to come in and drink a cup of coffee and then park and move the car for nearly 30 minutes until the ice melts?, meanwhile, the attitude of both the manager and parking lot staff is very mixed, like it's too crowded and doesn't care and wants to chase customers away. I told the staff to call the manager to discuss or ask about the rules and working style here. He said the manager was busy and couldn't come. This is a sincere suggestion. If the Hl Management Board reads it, please fix it",

She gave me the cash back but her attitude was not happy.\n\nA moment later, my friend came and ran back to tell me that he didn't have any cash and thought he could pay online. I just stood up to ask, but the cashier glanced at me and told my friend that the other employee had gone home and couldn't transfer the money! After that, I ignored my friend and didn't support me at all and didn't want to sell my water either :))\n\nWe also have money to transfer money when we call, not beggars! While other places always leave QR codes to scan to limit contact, here they probably only sell to customers who have cash and dress beautifully and luxuriously!",

Air-conditioner !\nThe water tastes delicious.\nI have to do a long review about H.C this place:\nHighlands Coffee Sense City is H.C's first facility when returning to Can Tho. Maybe before 2014 - 2015.\nLocation: located in Sense City shopping mall, with Coopmark supermarket, CGV movie theater,... on the 2nd floor are clothes shops, restaurants... a lot of expensive things.\nSpace: there are 2 areas\nThe indoor air-conditioned area has about 10 tables\nThe outside area, where smoking is allowed, is also a bit sunny, but when it rains it gets splashed with water\nDrink quality: delicious. Exactly like other H.C stores in the same system. So there's nothing to discuss.\nThe staff is cheerful and enthusiastic.\nPayment: MoMo, Bank card, Napas, VISA, MasterCard, cash.\nOrder: first come, first served, queue. Paying in advance at the counter makes many people in Can Tho confused (because the restaurant usually serves first and pays later).",

I saw there were cups and a vase so while standing in line and looking at the vase to see and buy, the employee at the counter wearing a \"store manager\" tag called me to order the goods. drank with a very dissatisfied attitude. I'm also in line to buy coffee pots and cups, so I don't understand the employee's attitude 🙂",
