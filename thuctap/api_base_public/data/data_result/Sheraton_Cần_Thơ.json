The location and the view were amazing given the hotel's location along the river and proximity to city centre. The buffet breakfast was outstanding, offering a wide variety of fresh and delicious options including a variety of Vietnamese coffee options. The staff were incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, providing excellent travel tips, including a recommendation to visit Con Son Island (fish farm), which turned out to be a highlight of our trip. Their attentiveness made exploring the region so much easier and more enjoyable. Additionally, the laundry service was efficient, handled with care, and offered great value. From the excellent amenities to the personalised service, the Sheraton Can Tho exceeded all expectations and made our stay truly memorable.",

The staff's warmth and hospitality made me and my family feel incredibly welcome from the moment we stepped in.\nA special shoutout to Amy, the hotel supervisor, who went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. My kids absolutely adore her, and my daughter still talks about the wonderful lady who sang \"Baby Shark\" with her. It's those little touches that make a big difference.\nThe breakfast buffet was a feast for the senses, offering an impressive variety of local delicacies, classic American breakfast options, and a delightful assortment of pastries. The staff's willingness to assist guests in getting their food was truly unique and added a special touch of personalized service.\nThe concierges at the Lounge deserve a standing ovation. They were incredibly friendly and resourceful, engaging my energetic children in fun activities so I could actually relax and unwind. They truly embodied the spirit of Mary Poppins, making our stay even more enjoyable.\nOverall, my experiences at Sheraton Can Tho have been nothing short of extraordinary. The hotel's commitment to providing exceptional service and creating a welcoming atmosphere has left a lasting impression on my family and me.

The bed was very comfortable and we slept very well (best and longest nights we had in Vietnam). I liked the attention to detail in the room. The windows offered great views of the city and river. The bathroom was clean and had a rain shower and good amenities.\n\nThe outdoor pool area was lovely. It's in a beautiful garden with lots of loungers. The pool was clean and well-maintained, a great place to relax after exploring Can Tho. The staff were very helpful, always ready to bring a drink or snack.\n\nThe Club Lounge was a highlight of my stay. The atmosphere was perfect for relaxing after a long day exploring the Mekong Delta. The evening cocktails and canapés were a great touch. The club lounge employees were so friendly and welcoming from the first day on.\n\nThe staff at the Sheraton Can Tho were attentive, professional, and went above and beyond to ensure my stay was perfect. I did experience a issue with the air conditioning in my room on the last night. However, after I reported it to the front desk, they immediately resolved the problem within minutes. The team even followed up with a call later to ensure everything was working fine and offered me a small compensation.\n\nOverall, the Sheraton Can Tho offers a luxurious and comfortable stay with top-notch amenities and a genuinely hospitable team. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a refined experience in the heart of the Mekong Delta. I definitely would return on my next visit at Can Tho.",

The buffet breakfast is spectacular and not to be missed. It remains my parents' favorite hotel breakfast out of all the five-star hotels in Vietnam where we stayed. The rooms were clean and well-maintained. The only negative I can say about the Sheraton is the location. We expected the riverwalk to be completed as it was still under construction during our visit last year. However, while the walkway is complete, portions are gated off, so you cannot walk from the Sheraton down to Ben Ninh Kieu. The riverwalk was also littered with dog droppings.

At that time, we were highly impressed as it aligned well with the standards of its international counterparts in terms of service and presentation.\n\nWe have always been happy to the Sheraton brand, consistently choosing their hotels as our preferred option when traveling, including Sheraton properties in Gold Coast, Melbourne, and Marriott.\n\nUnfortunately, during this recent stay, we were left with the impression that the focus has shifted towards maximizing revenue, rather than maintaining the quality of service we expect from a 5-star establishment. When booking through Agoda, we believed that the two rooms we reserved accommodated three adults each, with breakfast included. However, we were disappointed to find that additional charges were required for the third person and breakfast, on top of the premium Sheraton rate.\n\nA 5-star hotel should not operate like a budget hotel, where guests are charged extra for amenities that should be included. This experience is unlike any we have encountered at other Sheraton properties worldwide, making it particularly disappointing that it occurred at the Can Tho branch.\n\nRegrettably, this will be our fourth and final visit.

It is probably the first time that I’ve seen a hotel room cleaned so meticulously!\n\nThe staff at the hotel are so warm and friendly. They greeted us with lovely smiles every time we arrived back from a long day of visiting family. The facilities at the hotel were amazing. The gym was spacious and had enough equipment, the pool was big with a lot of sun beds and the spa services were so relaxing.\n\nThe hotel is also located in a great area. It is close to a lot of shops and restaurants. We loved spending time in the hotel.

Moreover, we are not professional “Hoteliers”, and the review is resulted from the actual experience.\nWe will review the hotel in three areas: Facility/Room/Breakfast, Location and Service\nFACILTIY/ROOM\nKhách sạn Sheraton Cần Thơ is best described with two words “well-managed”.  It is the only visible sky scraper from the distance as you are entering the city limit.\nIts only competition is Azerai Can Tho which located on a tiny river-island.  Because of its isolated landscape, Azerai Can Tho may not be a worthy competitor for Sheraton Can Tho.\nThe room décor, bed comfort and space is on par its peers back in the United States.  The view of the city and the river from the room is spectacular.\nThe gym is decent and on par with its peers.\nBreakfast is a buffet with a good mixture of Westerns and Asians.\nNoted – many Vietnam high end hotels supplement its income with domestic tour groups.  Noises late into the night and at breakfast can be a deal breaker for international visitors.\nWe booked 3 nights on the weekend and personally experienced a mixture of 3 types of guests, loud tour groups, high school field trip students and city business groups mingled with local politicians.\nOn our first night, we were awaked with loud talking guests at midnight; noted that the issue is promptly resolved the next morning with front desk staffs.\nLOCATION\nThe hotel is strategically on the newer section of the city development.  It is a 10 – 15 minutes to a nearby traditional market.\nYou will still need a motor bike for exploration of other interesting areas of the city.\nSERVICE\nVietnam is slowly moving away from “OPPORTUNIST” economy base society.  It is very challenging to train employees to do their job and keep to themselves without fishing for “OPPORTUNITY” from the hotel guests; although, we did experience an up-sale from one particular dining staff.\nCustomer service is where Khách sạn Sheraton Cần Thơ  shines.  The hotel has a good management team.  All employees are well trained.  Most will speak enough English for their particular job responsibility; and most importantly keep to themselves in present of hotel guests.\nOverall, we would give Khách sạn Sheraton Cần Thơ 4.5 out of 5.0 rating for its value and price of 3 nights experience of stay on 5/10/2024, 5/11/2024 and 5/12/2024.",

Our experience was nothing short of exceptional, thanks to the outstanding staff who went above and beyond to make our stay memorable.\n\nThe team at Sheraton Can Tho, particularly Du, Tien, and Huy from the lobby bar, demonstrated an unparalleled commitment to customer service. Their warm welcomes, attention to detail, and genuine friendliness created an inviting atmosphere that made us feel right at home. Whether we were seeking local recommendations or enjoying a relaxing evening at the bar, their hospitality truly stood out.\n\nOur mornings were equally delightful, thanks to the impeccable service at the breakfast buffet. Tran and Huyen (Ka) provided exemplary service, ensuring that every meal was a delightful experience. Their genuine smiles and proactive approach added an extra layer of warmth to the dining experience.\n\nThe hotel also connected us with an amazing tour service of the Cai Rang floating markets.\n\nThe Sheraton Can Tho's commitment to customer satisfaction, as exemplified by Du, Tien, Huy, Tran, and Huyen (Ka), made our stay unforgettable. I highly recommend this hotel to fellow travelers seeking not just accommodation but an exceptional hospitality experience in the heart of Vietnam.

The bed was large and extremely comfortable and the bedding had a luxury feel to it..  The bathroom was also a good size with both a shower area and a bath, which I really like. (The shower did tend to leak water below the shower door.... this was the only little niggle in an otherwise perfect stay).\nThe general manager even personally helped us choose a trip in the local delta which was much appreciated, the boat trip and afternoon cycle was very memorable.\nThe front of house staff were all excellent and always offering assistance and a smile, particular mention must go to Ngoc Hang and the bell boy, Thai Hung who could not do enough to make our stay perfect and seemed to be there every time we passed the front desk, once again much appreciated.\nThe pool was a welcome highlight, its a \"huge\" pool with lots of sunbeds always available, ideal to relax after a day out exploring.\nThe buffet breakfast was a great way to start the day, huge choice of both Vietnamese and western dishes. There was so much to choose from one, of the best buffets we have seen on our recent travels.\nThe market area is a short walk away and only a few minutes in a taxi for about 30,000 VND......\nIn summary we would not hesitate to stay at the Vinpearl in Can Tho should we be back in the area again, indeed it has made us think of booking further stays at the Vinpearl Group o our next visit to Vietnam.\nCan't wait to return.....
