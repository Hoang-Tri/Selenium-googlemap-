Sadly, the ride was short of good, and the food was mediocre at best.\n\nBoat ride: With the expectation of a moving boat accompanying sights and views of the river, you only get about 5 minutes of the boat going. Then the boat makes a slow rotation and your headed back to base.\n\nMusic on the boat was ok. Was not the best as it only included traditional music.\n\nFood: Orders of food was pricey. Even the sodas were pricey. The best deal you would get is ordering one of the hotpot. Anything else, don't say you weren't warned. But, to be fare, it's a tourist attraction. So pricey food is expected.\n\nOverall, this boat dinner affair isn't good. Many things can be improved. Many things can be possible, should the owners want it better to represent Vietnam.",

He was very gentle, typical of a simple Westerner, and did not compete with rowdy guests, so I found it very peaceful. The day I went, there were only 2 people (including the boat) and each person cost 150k, so I didn't have to pair up with anyone so I felt very comfortable. Besides, I still got all the places. The small boat runs slower than the boats of other groups. Although it's a bit slow, it's a great experience on the river. Here is my phone number for everyone to contact: 039607209",

The atmosphere here is very pleasant, the river breeze blows coolly, creating a feeling of relaxation. Walking along the river, I saw many people strolling, exercising and chatting loudly. Along the wharf, there are many restaurants with all kinds of delicious Western dishes, especially fresh seafood dishes and typical fish sauce hotpot.\nA big plus is that the cruise ship terminal is very busy. If you have time, you can take a boat trip on the river, sightseeing and enjoying amateur music. However, during rush hour, the station is quite crowded so it is sometimes a bit noisy and difficult to find an ideal seat. In addition, some areas still have garbage, which needs to be improved to preserve the beauty of the landscape.\nHowever, Ninh Kieu Wharf is still a destination worth visiting if you want to feel the beauty of Can Tho at night.
