The first time I asked someone to help me take a photo, the photographer refused, while the shooting time was faster than standing and explaining to the customer. The second time I went, I made a mistake and was missing ingredients. When I asked, the staff just kept silent and walked away, with no attitude to solve the problem and just ignored the situation. Hopefully the restaurant will improve the quality of service and preparation.",

While the coffee itself had a taste reminiscent of sugar water‚Äîperhaps a bit sweeter than I prefer‚ÄîI found several redeeming qualities that made my visit worthwhile.\n\nFirstly, the cleanliness of the establishment was impressive. The bright, tidy tables and well-maintained surroundings contributed to a welcoming atmosphere that invited you to linger. The spacious layout allowed for comfortable seating, whether you were looking to enjoy a quiet moment alone or catch up with friends.\n\nMoreover, the service was a standout feature. The staff was genuinely friendly and attentive, making sure that I felt right at home. Their willingness to help and offer recommendations added a personal touch to my visit.\n\nOverall, while the coffee might not have been my favorite, the combination of a clean, spacious environment and excellent service made it a pleasant experience. I would definitely consider coming back, perhaps to try something different from the menu!",

Coffee cultivars originate from tropical Africa and the Madagascar, Comoros, Mauritius and R√©union regions of the Indian Ocean.[2] This variety is exported from Africa to countries around the world and is now grown in a total of more than 70 countries, mainly in areas near the equator in the Americas, Southeast Asia, India and Africa. The two most commonly grown coffee varieties are arabica, and robusta. After ripening, the coffee berries will be picked, processed and dried. Dried coffee beans will be roasted under many different temperature conditions, depending on your tastes. After roasting, coffee beans will be ground and brewed with boiling water to create coffee in the form of a drink.",
