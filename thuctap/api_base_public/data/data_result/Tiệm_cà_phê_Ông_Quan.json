Go straight into the alley, run to the end of the alley, you will see two large bushes looking straight at the river, just run straight towards the river, go through the bushes and look on the right side to reach the shop.\nThe parking lot is perfect. At first I was a bit worried because I didn't see a parking attendant. Later, I saw a male friend sitting, but customers should lead the car themselves. The parking lot is spacious so driving is not too difficult, but if you enter a coffee shop without being asked if you can drive, points will be deducted.\nVirtual living angles are nothing to discuss, almost all angles can be photographed in Da Lat style. The shop has a lot of space, I think each space creates a unique feeling. Actually, even though I'm a fan of the air-conditioned coffee system, I really like it here. The shop is well lit so you don't have to worry about not being able to take pictures at night.\nThere is a seat indoors, upstairs in the right corner. I think sitting there is ok for 2 or 3 people, but there is no barrier so it will be a bit dangerous and not suitable for guests afraid of heights.\nThe stairs upstairs are a bit steep and small, so you can go up there to play but be careful, especially if you wear tall sandals or large cross sandals like me.\nI think the price for drinks is reasonable for the space and quality. The staff are lovely and have a pot of tea for you.",

My lover had a sore throat and couldn't drink fruit tea, so I told him to wait a bit. The staff at the counter kept pestering us with a super annoying voice (please give us another drink) and then glared at the restaurant with a very nice view, but the space to take Christmas photos was very narrow and small, it was very crowded so we couldn't take photos. There were a few staff members who were very gentle and asked permission to drink the water. After drinking it, we went back to buy some sore throat medicine, it was as sweet as sugar water and didn't have any peach scent at all. In Can Tho, there are many places with beautiful views and It's much more worthy, so please consider it to have a better experience",

Whenever there was water, we went to the counter to receive water. When it rang, we went to get it, but the staff yelled at us, why don't we get water again? It's all melted. We also said that for a while we didn't see the oder card ringing, but when it rang, we took it right away, but we didn't want to take it again. Then another guy in the shop asked someone to try pressing card 32 to see if it rang. I stood there looking and didn't hear anything.
