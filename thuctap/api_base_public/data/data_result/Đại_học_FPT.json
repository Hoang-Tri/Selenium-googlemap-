In the lecture hall, there is wifi but it is also weak and controlled so you can't play games 😡",

If you don't pass many exams, you'll be able to wear a martial arts uniform for half the semester and then pass it again without getting a belt or anything. In general, at this school, all the teachers are cute and all the subjects are worthwhile except for subjects. Martial arts is very confusing and doesn't understand how to schedule classes school",
