You can go to the shop to experience it to have more objective assessments 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟",

There is also coffee in bed/box, overnight coffee,... All are very cool air-conditioned. There is a table reservation service at the restaurant\nMenu has quite a lot of drinks. If you buy to take away, the price will be the same 20k/cup.\nOrder at the counter, pay and serve yourself water 😐\nI don't like the shop's milk coffee, it's too sweet, like candy, but the coffee doesn't smell very fragrant. In general, the coffee here is mild.",
