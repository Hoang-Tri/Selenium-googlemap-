I don't know if you're joking or serious, but in my opinion, I'm not happy or satisfied. And the room is cold, so I said why isn't it cold? Then you change the number of guests in and out. The door is closed so it's not cold. I don't understand. I drank at Pham1's house from the time it opened until the branch opened. All the staff were always happy and cute.
