This collaboration will focus on several key areas: 1. Industry-academia collaboration between Taiwanese and Vietnamese businesses: We will facilitate partnerships between Taiwanese and Vietnamese businesses to promote industry-academia collaboration. This will involve connecting businesses with universities and research institutions to share knowledge and resources, and to develop joint projects and training programs. 2. Mentorship for student entrepreneurs: We will provide mentorship and support to student entrepreneurs at FPT University Can Tho. This will involve providing guidance on business development, fundraising, and market entry strategies. We will also connect students with potential investors and partners. 3. Internship and market expansion opportunities for Taiwanese businesses: We will connect Taiwanese businesses with internship and market expansion opportunities in Vietnam. This will involve helping businesses find qualified interns and employees, and identifying potential partners and customers in Vietnam. ‚ñ∫ I would like to express my gratitude to Vice President Mr. Bay for his strong support of this partnership. I share his vision of providing students with opportunities to learn and work in an international environment, and to develop their skills in multiple domains. I would also like to thank Mr. Luan , a long-time friend, for his instrumental role in bringing this partnership to fruition. ‚ñ∫ In the spirit of collaboration, we are inviting several Taiwanese organizations and schools to join us in this partnership. We will provide the necessary resources to support our students and partners in achieving their goals. This partnership is not only about providing opportunities for students to learn and work in an international environment, but also about helping more Taiwanese businesses succeed in the Vietnamese market. ‚ñ∫ Taiwanese businesses can collaborate with FPT University Can Tho and local businesses on research and technology transfer projects. They can also participate in entrepreneurship programs and competitions organized by FPT University. I encourage everyone to join us in this exciting collaboration.
