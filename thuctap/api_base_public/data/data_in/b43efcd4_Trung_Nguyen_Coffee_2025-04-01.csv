Luxurious space suitable for working and receiving guests. The cafe sits on the ground floor and 1st floor, above the 2nd floor there is a meditation room area. Food and drink prices are quite high. Silver is 65k, salted coffee is 89k. Drinks come with candy, quotes, detailed information about the drink, and a delicious and cool cup of bean tea. The staff constantly refills the tea. Coffee in Trung Nguyen, in my personal opinion, is delicious, but the price is quite high so I don't often sit there."

Tasty. However, as for this location, this is the first place I visited to enjoy Trung Nguyen nearly 10 years ago. Because me and my friends are in District 10. I got married to GV, so every night when I go on dates with friends, I choose TN HVT in the middle, so this shop is so familiar. Until one of her friends hunted for something and occasionally got a discount code. Every time I use a discount code, it means the service is poor. Normally for glass cups and crockery cups, there is a discount code for portable plastic S size cups to take away even if customers are already seated at the table. While going to other TN Legend at the Airport or District 10, they are still served in glass or ceramic cups. I'm allergic to coffee made from plastic cups. It loses the delicious taste of coffee. Sometimes there are discount codes, but that kind of service is really ""disrespecting customers"". I think the restaurant should change this service style. Now my friends don't want to go to this restaurant anymore. Normally there is no discount code, so I happily order a portion of Rumi Cafe for 129k. Don't look down on customers holding discount codes. Discourage this point. It's lovely to have Mr. NV keep the car."

When he left to pick up the car, he only came to pick up the ticket while his eyes were still focused on the phone screen playing games. - Trung Nguyen HVT has just had a change in service staff and the feeling is that Trung Nguyen no longer really cares about staff training. When guests came in, there was no greeting even though my companion and I politely said ""hello"". When going to the 2nd floor, it was no exception, the staff did not greet guests at all. - When ordering, they didn't say anything, didn't confirm what the customer ordered, and didn't even say yes - Actually, the image of the employee making a drink while mouthing something is very offensive. The male waiter on the 2nd floor yesterday left me with a very bad impression about that. - Normally when I leave, I always receive thanks from the staff. I was even very impressed with the cashier girl on the first floor a while ago because of her friendliness. But nowadays, employees hardly know how to say thank you Maybe I'm picky myself, but if I work on service, I think it's better to have perfection to create a good impression on customers."

I asked the staff to turn down the heat to make it cooler, but the staff said the air conditioner couldn't be adjusted. This is funny. 3. My coffee taste level is not high, so drinking a 50k cup of coffee doesn't feel any different from other shops. The price is high compared to other brand shops such as: Cop Phe Hao, Twice... only 30k. The green tea and jelly are only average, and the prices are still higher than other shops. In short, the price is high, the taste is nothing better. 4. The service staff is normal, not as welcoming and cheerful as other branded shops. There is a separate ground floor for gentlemen to smoke, another point of difference. There were books to win people's hearts and encourage learning on each guest's table, but I noticed that no one had them in their hands."

I discussed that I don't need service, I just need to turn on the air conditioner for me and the staff agreed but they still didn't open it, it felt like They are very indifferent to customers. If they don't agree, just talk frankly with the customer, you can't say one thing and do another like that. 3. Wifi on the 3rd floor is extremely slow and almost impossible to access.  In my opinion, if you pay a higher price to go to Trung Nguyen, the amenities they bring must be better.
