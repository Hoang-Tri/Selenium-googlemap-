Sadly, the ride was short of good, and the food was mediocre at best.  Boat ride: With the expectation of a moving boat accompanying sights and views of the river, you only get about 5 minutes of the boat going. Then the boat makes a slow rotation and your headed back to base.  Music on the boat was ok. Was not the best as it only included traditional music.  Food: Orders of food was pricey. Even the sodas were pricey. The best deal you would get is ordering one of the hotpot. Anything else, don't say you weren't warned. But, to be fare, it's a tourist attraction. So pricey food is expected.  Overall, this boat dinner affair isn't good. Many things can be improved. Many things can be possible, should the owners want it better to represent Vietnam."

There’s some larger boats that you can board with mini markets. Other larger boats will line the shores and may have restrooms and a small dining area.  For the best experience, doc at one of the tourist ports for hot food and restrooms. The floating market is a great experience."

If you finish the road along Hau river side you will pass by Victoria Hotel. It is a long walking but worth to do.

There is a quite busy market, I didn't ask the price so I don't know what the prices of the items here are. In the evening, there is a walking street with many houses built a long time ago, creating an ancient feeling. It's like getting lost in buildings like in a Hong Kong movie.  Nowadays, the wharf is mainly used for tourism purposes, but there is rarely any commercial space like before. I heard people here say that in the past, when there was no urbanization, it was much more fun.

Walking along the river, I saw many people strolling, exercising and chatting loudly. Along the wharf, there are many restaurants with all kinds of delicious Western dishes, especially fresh seafood dishes and typical fish sauce hotpot. A big plus is that the cruise ship terminal is very busy. If you have time, you can take a boat trip on the river, sightseeing and enjoying amateur music. However, during rush hour, the station is quite crowded so it is sometimes a bit noisy and difficult to find an ideal seat. In addition, some areas still have garbage, which needs to be improved to preserve the beauty of the landscape.
