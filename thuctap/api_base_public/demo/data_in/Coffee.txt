There is a spacious, airy space beautifully decorated Puka wholeheartedly cares about customers with beautiful amusement parks and cool, clean, safe swimming pools There is a cool chill area upstairs where students üë©‚Äçüéì can study and do homework.
		- Qu·ªëc Uy 8A4 Nguy·ªÖn (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-06-28): A coffee shop that everyone loves, the shop is very concerned and worried about the health of its customers. The cafe has a beautiful view, is airy, clean and safe, and has a water park that is super clean, safe, and dedicated. It's a bit too much :))))))
		- Quoc Phuong Nguyen (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Great space from food to drinks. The shop owner invests very well so that children can play and parents can freely chat. It's worth stopping and waiting to walk Ninh Kieu ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
		- Huy L√™ (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Spacious and airy space! Beautiful drinks, prices are a bit high compared to the general area but reasonable with the service of the restaurant. There is a children's play area, suitable for parents with small children to meet. The toilet is clean.
		- V√µ Ho√†ng Danh (3.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): The food is very sweet Sweet drinks and food High price The shop is spacious, has a play area for children (tickets are required!) In short: this shop is for people with a sweet tooth, the experience is terrible!!!
		- Hung Ngo (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): There is a pretty good outdoor play area for children, 50k/child. Clean, food ok, prices a bit high.

		- Toni Tr√¢ÃÄn (3.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): My family went on the weekend and it was quite crowded. But I stopped by Puka Land amusement park for my grandchild to play, so I wanted to try it out. Puka land amusement park entrance ticket for children is 50k. If you just want to come drink coffee, there is a small play area for children at the shop for free. You don't have to come to drink coffee and play in Puka land for free. Evaluation of food and drinks is very normal, prices compared to this quality are quite expensive. I ordered 1 fried bread, and the product I received was 2 fried eggs, 3 pieces of cucumber and 1 loaf of bread, price 29k. The drink I call iced yogurt is normal, usually when I make yogurt at home I add condensed milk, a little sugar and squeeze in a slice of lemon. Here, it's simply a pot of yogurt poured in with ice on top and a straw added In general, I just came to experience, have no intention of coming back, and you who come here should check the price and consider before coming.

reviews:
		- Quynh Nguyen Thi Nhu (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): Love their coffee, especially hot latte. The owner was supa friendly, there are 3 fat dogs as well. Definitely will visit them again.
		- Ho√†i Nam Tr·∫ßn (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-01-28): Homemade ice, having Arabica option. Chill and relax.
		- Khiem Huynh (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-04-28): One of the best coffee in Cantho. The owner is very knowledgeable in coffee.
		- Vulcain Duquesne (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Really great place to enjoy a great coffee and a good coffee-related conversation.  The owner is extremely friendly and helpful. He knows his coffee, coffee machines and roasting process very well.  Would definitely recommend for a good coffee.  Cheers
		- Tomek G (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Great owner and Arabica coffee, straight from Da Lat !  Tip : add some plants/green and that will be the perfect place :)
		- Nguyen Chanh Minh Tri (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Best coffee, best barista in CanTho city.

		- L√™ Minh Hi·∫øu (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-07-28): Great coffee
		- Anh Qu√≠ L√™ (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Spacious, friendly and comfortable is what I immediately felt when I visited HAT Specialty Coffee. Regarding the quality of the water, I can't rate it highly because the day I visited HAT, because I ordered the 4th glass on the menu, the remaining ingredients were out of ingredients so I couldn't fully experience it.  The big plus is that the shop has an open space, very comfortable because there are not many customers taking photos. Regarding the menu, I suggest that there should be enough ingredients for customers to have a better experience.
		- TruLy (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): Just discovered a "gem" for coffee enthusiasts - Specialty Coffee & Roastery. The first impression is the green space with many ornamental plants, minimalist but cozy design. Especially excited about the restaurant's two adorable puppies, who always run to greet customers with friendly eyes.  The shop owner is not only knowledgeable about coffee but is also very enthusiastic about sharing his knowledge about types of beans, roasting and preparation. Every cup of Specialty coffee here is a work of art, with a delicate, rich flavor that is hard to find elsewhere. Will definitely become my regular destination!
		- Nguyen Nguyen (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-10-28): Cool garden cafe. Espresso bases using Arabica beans are quite good, do not burn or smell of smoke. Drinkable if you crave a good cup of espresso. Not excellent, but it's too good compared to the Western region.
		- Mint (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): The shop is located in a small street, but easy to find. Outside is a yard, tables and chairs, lots of seating, quiet. Guests come in and out frequently but mainly sit in the space in front of the yard. The space inside is quite simple. There's a cute golden baby hanging around customers.. The coffee is delicious and fragrant, the shop's equipment is modern, and the price is cheap compared to the owner's quality and investment. You should try it. But around 18 or 19 o'clock the restaurant stopped accepting customers. I don't know what happens on other days. Everyone should ask the boss again.
		- Elvira (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-08-28): I judge coffee by a hot, sugar-free latte. And I‚Äôm very happy when they smile knowingly at me when I ask for no sugar in Vietnam üòÑ (this is rare, often perplexing, ü§£they put a lot of sugar in local types of coffee, sometimes in lattes, if you don‚Äôt warn). My husband rates by espresso. If we like it, then any type of coffee in this cafe will be 100% delicious! Here I already understood from the appearance of the latte that it would be delicious. correct drink temperature and good foam, quality Arabica beans and an involved barista. And also very friendly service and attentiveness. Despite the fact that only one person works. It is clear that he works in his place, doing what suits him. Latte from here is one of my tops now in Vietnam (we visited all the southern provinces, lived in Ho Chi Minh City and Central Vietnam)!!!
		- Tr√¢n V√µ B·∫£o (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-09-28): Tasty. Price is okay. Delicious matcha latte. Crossaint cake is fragrant with butter and has a crispy crust when hot. There's also a cute four-legged "handrail".
		- Arckyn Nightingale (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-07-28): The restaurant does everything at an average level, but there is nothing to criticize, everything is just enough.
		- Mai Bi (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-07-28): The coffee is very delicious, and there are also two cute four-legged employees
		- HO√ÄNG LONG NGUY·ªÑN (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): It's a bit surprising because the shop has had CT for more than a year before I knew about this shop. This shop is very suitable for those who like coffee
		- AT (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Even though the owner changed the machine, his skills are so high that the quality is still top notch. The nut milk is quite delicious, the two dogs in the yard are so cute. Clean toilet, 10 points.
		- V√¢n Anh Khu·∫•t Th·ªã (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): The shop specializes in all kinds of coffee. Coffee and cakes are both very good quality. The restaurant space is clean, cool, and pleasant.
		- The Vietnamese (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): The small shop mainly serves special, quality drinks, quiet space, few customers, suitable for people who like quiet and good coffee.

		- Tunny Dang (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-04-28): The owner is enthusiastic. Truly delicious coffee for connoisseurs, I really like homemade cakes to eat with it. An ideal place to study and work for students and office workers
		- Thi Nguyen (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): I'm not a coffee drinker. When I stopped by the shop and didn't know what to drink, I just told him I didn't know how to drink coffee. He made a cup of iced milk coffee with more milk, more ice and less coffee ü§£ Since I don't know, I can't comment on the coffee.  I like this place because it has many trees üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç because the owner also knows how to take care of the trees, so every tree looks amazing üòÆ

		- C√¥ng Qu√≠ (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): The shop is beautiful and well-groomed, with very enthusiastic consulting service. The country has a rich diversity, especially beautiful decor. Here I ordered Lemongrass Yogurt, the presentation is eye-catching, the flavor is different from other shops, the cream layer is just sweet enough, low fat, the cakes are also delicious. Cool, quiet space for working, studying, chatting, it's so okela...
		- l√¢m hi·ªÅn (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Plus point: drinking water helps you reduce sugar levels. So I think it's quite delicious. Good service, friendly and cute Delicious ice cream, make your own ice cream, add toppings as you like. The price of each item is 50k/100g, which is a bit high. Minus point: the parking lot is super small and can only hold a few cars. The space is nothing special. The design is a bit of a waste of space.
		- Th∆∞ Tr·∫ßn (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-04-28): The space is spacious, cool, suitable for working, studying and chatting with friends. The staff is friendly and very helpful!

		- Duy Hu·ª≥nh Th√°i (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): The atmosphere of Christmas üéÑ is coming. Have you found a place to check in yet? Today I accidentally got lost in alley 51 and from afar I saw the name of the restaurant so I decided to try it out and see what it was like. I feel satisfied with everything. The water is very delicious. The staff is very happy and enthusiastic. Especially the Christmas decor of the shop is very beautiful and cozy. The pine tree is very big and beautiful.

		- Nguy·ªÖn Th√†nh Long (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-04-28): Delicious drinks, cute staff, very beautiful decor, 10 VND for this kindness ü´∂üèª
		- H·ªìng Ng·ªçc (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): 158g is 79k guys, not a single piece has been deducted. Ice cream 50k/100g, weigh the toppings to calculate the price, do not tell the customer in advance. Add tapioca pearls and water chestnuts and weigh them while I didn't ask for extra toppings, resulting in a jar of ice cream worth 79k. Machine-made ice cream is not ice cream anymore. Much more expensive than on SG =))
		- V√µ Ho√†ng Giang (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-04-28): The shop is spacious, cool, suitable for relaxing, playing, studying

The noise from the cashew ice cream maker makes me crazy. Where is the owner? Why don't you come and sit for 30 minutes to see if you can stand it?

		- BH Th∆∞∆°ng (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): The service is really bad, even though there are many staff, they still have to bring their own water. I don't think they can serve me. Good water prices are a bit high compared to the average.
		- H∆∞∆°ng B√©o (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): The shop has plenty of places to take photos, and the staff is nice and chatty. Delicious drink that suits my taste, can reduce the sweetness as required, and prepares quite quickly.
		- Tr·∫ßn T√∫ Linh 13-12-03 (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Extremely bad experience at the restaurant today. There weren't so many customers that they had to wait 40 minutes for 2 glasses of water. :)) At first, around 15 minutes, I came to the girls and said, "Hey, do you have these two glasses?", the girls also told me to wait. I can wait until 40 minutes and still not have two drinks even though the people who came in later, I have to say that in front of me I see 5 or 6 people coming in a long time after me and still have water? If I don't mention it, I don't have a product. I have no opinion. I feel like sitting there for 40 minutes and no one cares? The cashier told the barista that "these two glasses are a bit long gone" but she still hasn't arrived after waiting for someone to pick them up and bring them back? Decided to throw away 2 glasses of water and will never come back because the service is so bad. Even if the restaurant finds that the customer's 2 glasses of water are not worth much, they should reconsider their way of doing things.
		- Ng√¢n Tr√∫c (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): First and last time visiting this restaurant. Let's not talk about my glass of water that was a bit bad and a bit expensive + the table I sat at was not cleaned, I had to clean it myself ü•≤. The story is that when I placed the order, I still had some money left, but my friend said that if he had enough money, he would send it to me later, but by the time I sat down, he still hadn't given it to me, so I rushed home so I forgot. When I came back to pick it up, you said YOU'RE HAVING YOUR MONEY HABIT, then you said "WHY DON'T YOU REMIND ME", so it was the customer's fault for not reminding you of your money habit. You say that when you haven't checked yet :))) I asked to check the cam, but the guy asked me or something, then said nothing and then gave me the money back. I'm just a gentle person, but I'm not trying to make things difficult, but I have such an attitude, so I'm sorry

Later, I saw the male employee making coffee for me and took another cup to get that cream. Don't know if it was accidental or intentional. Good drink quality but disappointing experience.

		- Huey Quan (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Very chilled coffee spot, nice all wood deco, it has three level, with comfy sofa seating. Prices are ok too, Vietnam iced coffee is 30k, while tiramisu costs 35k
		- Miroslav Lazic (Miki) (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Awesome Awesome awesome üòç one of the best spots in the city. Wonderful overall experience. If google would allow, I'd rate it 7* out of 5*.
		- Dr De (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Found this place by accident and took a liking to the design of this place. Drinks are so so for this price point, need improvement to promote the brand.

		- Nguy·ªÖn Ho√†ng Duy (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): The drinks are good, the space is well invested, the staff is good, there is parking, suitable for those who want a quiet place to chat on the weekend, freelancers working here are very ideal, Reasonable price, if you sit all day, order 2 or 3 glasses to drink freely. Location is easy to find. The owner must be very dedicated and spend a lot of money on decoration, so he can come often without fear of getting bored.
		- Tri·ªÅu D∆∞∆°ng (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-09-28): I visited in mid-September 2024, in a few days it will be Mid-Autumn Festival, so the shop is decorated with all kinds of lanterns quite beautifully. The design inside the shop is quite beautiful, with many large Fern trees and arch-shaped wood. Roasted and ground coffee beans brewed in the machine have a common flavor, nothing special. The space is more suitable for groups of friends than couples. I saw about 4-5 employees inside the shop, including cashiers, PCs, and service staff. I drank all the tea and couldn't see any more tea, nor did I see them coming to pour tea for other tables. The price of water is not cheap, although the layout of the photography corner is not much.
		- Nguy·ªÖn Ph∆∞∆°ng Ng·ªçc (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): The Christmas decor is very nice, delicious drinks, friendly staff

		- Minh Ngoc (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-10-28): Natural, a warm and very poetic space of the Western river. Thank you guide. A wonderful evening!
		- Olivia Smith (Annie Nguyen) (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-09-28): Delicious water, many different types, beautiful space to study and work. The price of water fluctuates around 35-50k, which in my opinion is a bit higher than other shops, but the mixed fruit juice is quite delicious so you can try to imitate it. One limitation is that there is no car parking space, right across the street there can be a maximum of 3 cars with 7 seats.
		- Trang Tran (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): The decor is stylish, beautiful, friendly and extremely thoughtful. Will stop by again when coming to Can Tho
		- Siphus (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): The drinks are moderately delicious, the restaurant space is spacious and beautiful
		- Cu Ru (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): If you love nature, want to enjoy coffee and need peace and quiet, Moc Nhien is the ideal place, the price is very reasonable, not too expensive, the space is green and cloudy. Service is friendly and very enthusiastic.  It's a very suitable place to meet friends, exchange work and even family members!
		- Mya Kaming (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Compared to the average, water prices are slightly higher. In return, the shop's space is very invested, from the ceiling, walls, trees to the decoration of water glasses. The shop is not big but has many floors and lots of space. Cool air conditioning, enthusiastic staff and quick preparation. Overall, I really like this restaurant, it's very stable. It's a pity that I haven't been able to visit everything yet. Will come back. Must-try
		- Do Thi Phuong Thao (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Recently, there are often groups of young people coming to talk loudly, affecting the people around them. One day my family could only sit for about 30 minutes before having to leave because the table next to us was playing cards and laughing loudly. I hope the staff will take the trouble to warn groups that are too noisy to avoid affecting others.
		- Lƒ©nh Nguy·ªÖn Tr·ªçng (Lƒ©nh Lƒ©nh) (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): - Staff: The staff here are lovely, especially the security guard who is extremely cute... I will come here to drink again because of the security guard, hehe - About the water: the water is very delicious, I recommend everyone to drink milk tea, it's delicious, everyone - about space: we came here to take beautiful photos, the trees here are very beautiful, everyone, don't pull the tree, it will turn ugly. Hey, it's so beautiful upstairs. Why don't you go upstairs and take pictures? - Coming here to play games to study or play cards or check in is all reasonable, everyone - The view of the shop is mainly brown and green, everyone
		- Nguy·ªÖn Duy Kh√°nh (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): The shop is beautiful, quiet, cool, the drinks are quite good, the shop is clean, the security guards are very cute. Suitable for work and study
		- Trang Huy·ªÅn (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Moc Nhien Cofee is a great place to drink with healthy drinks. The water in the shop is very fresh, full of vitamins and reduces the feeling of fatigue. The space in the restaurant is spacious and clean, creating a comfortable feeling for customers. The staff in the restaurant are very enthusiastic and dedicated, supporting customers in the best way. The price of water at the restaurant is also very reasonable and suitable for customers' budgets. I highly recommend the cafe and recommend you try it once if you want to find a place to drink healthy water.
		- Ph√πng B·∫£o Xuy√™n (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): The shop's Christmas decorations are extremely beautiful, the shop space is not large but has invested in reasonable decoration and layout, not too crammed. I haven't had a drink yet, but I already fell in love with the beautiful shop. Guava tea is quite ok.
		- D∆∞∆°ng Th√πy (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Fun staff, delicious drinks, beautiful set up
		- Nh∆∞ Hu·ª≥nh Nguy·ªÖn (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-05-28): I've visited the restaurant a few times during holidays like bth and always found the service to be good, but the number of times I've ordered the same type each time, it's not so great. But the decor vs space is 10 VND, there is no such thing, the air conditioner is always cool, but during holidays it gets a bit crowded so those who like quiet should take note.
		- Thai MX (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): The restaurant has a nice view, air-conditioned space, enthusiastic and friendly staff, ok drinks, prices are a bit high
		- Son Thi Thuy Trang (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): 1. Spacious space, great view. There are many shooting angles. 2. Water prices are quite high, but worth it for the service and space here. 3. Bonus points for being overly protective. From alley 51, go straight near the end of the street and you will see the shop. Quite far.
		- Nguy·ªÖn Ho√†ng Minh Huy (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): I came to the restaurant on Christmas, the decoration is super good, the drinks are delicious and suitable for the budget, the staff is very friendly and polite, the parking lot of the restaurant is spacious, the way to get to the restaurant is also very easy if there is a chance. Please come and experience it, overall the restaurant is very good

		- nguy·ªÖn ph√∫ (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): The restaurant has a super nice interior decoration and reasonably priced drinks. There is also a beautiful, cool rooftop.  Great decor, good drinks, affordable prices.
		- H·ªì B√© Linh (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): In the evening to discuss business with the baby, the two sisters stopped by Moc Nhien, a shop mainly designed with wood, honeycomb-oriented structure combined with warm yellow lights and green plants. Inside there are large and small tables suitable for quiet work.
		- D∆∞∆°ng Nh√£ VƒÉn (2.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): The first time we came to the restaurant, our group was a bit shy but still very polite, but the ordering staff was very polite towards us.
		- Ho√†ng Ph∆∞∆°ng L√™ (2.0‚≠ê, 2024-12-28): Our group was traveling with many people, so it took a little while to order, but the staff showed their attitude right away. Wait for us to leave and show your attitude that you're okay. Why are you like this? Quite disappointing.
		- TriÃ£nh Khanh (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): The shop is very beautiful, many different spaces, order at the counter, there are staff serving drinks at the table, the shop is a place to gather friends to play red and black, the shop has many trees, decoration changes according to events and holidays, ok staff, large parking lot, but no cover, it gets wet after rain, the location is very easy to find. Water price from 27k or more. Cakes are available. Can eat and drink at the restaurant
		- Nguy·ªÖn Qu·ªëc Vinh (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): About Space‚Äù Just once you set foot in the shop, you will immediately be delighted with the shop's unique decor.

Every corner of the picture is sparkling. üç± About Moc Nhien's menu ‚òòÔ∏èVery diverse from traditional dishes to modern dishes. What's special is that Moc Nhien chooses fresh fruits to ensure the health and safety of Moc Nhien's guests.

		- Quang Le (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): The shop has a beautiful, unique design in Da Lat style, friendly staff, service staff, diverse payments such as momo,... The drink is quite ordinary, not very special, moderately priced, with parking on the ground floor On weekends, it is quite crowded and noisy due to children running around, customers who go to coffee shops are too conscious and let their children run around screaming.
		- Nha Le (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): So cute! The restaurant is delicious and beautiful It takes a bit of time to order and pay, but it's okay to make up for the comfortable space :))

		- Th√°i B√πi (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): The glass space is air-conditioned but the green deco is very comfortable. It looks cramped from the outside, but when you get inside it's like being in a garden Mid-Autumn Festival also increases the number of lights for children to travel with.
		- Ng·ªçc B√πi (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Nice Christmas night restaurant. Bad service staff. The hot liptop cup took 1 hour to bring out. The water must have been cold on Christmas night so it took 1 hour to cook

		- Hi·∫øu Thu·∫≠n H·ªì (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Drinks are normal, due to the structure of the restaurant, it is difficult to call the staff. You cannot eat food in the room, you have to go out to eat. Overall feeling is not too bad but not satisfied either

I give a score of 10 for the design of the shop. Personally, I think the drinks are quite good and the service is also very good. The shop is often crowded in the evening. On the rooftop you can enjoy a beautiful view of the lake.

		- ngan le (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Moc Nhien is one of the cafes that I think of first when I intend to go with friends. Naturally there is a pleasant space in the room suitable for studying and working in groups. However, I like the terrace space more, when sitting on the terrace you will see the panoramic view of the area behind CTU, Vincom Xuan Khanh and Muong Thanh Hotel, besides on clear days you can see the view. The night sky view is wonderful. However, the price of water ranges from 30 to 50 twigs, and the water quality I rate is average to good.
