reviews:
		- Oscar (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Not bad to do some shopping. The prices are similar to Europe. Dresses for 60-100 euros. Not too much variety of food.
		- Sun Pham (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): Attentive security staff. Huge parking lot
		- D Sundance (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Vincom Plaza Xuan Khanh has 6 floors. In the basement, you will find winmart where you can buy fresh produce, frozen food, household essentials, and clothes, and there is also an aisle with some toys and stationery items. They also serve a selection of hot food there every day. There is also Medicare on this floor where you can buy many products for health and beauty care. On the ground floor, there are selection clothes stores selling shoes, sports wear, watches, jewellery, sunglasses, perfume, and havianna flip-flops. There is also a restaurant and highlands coffee shop. On the second level, you will find more clothes stores and luggage stores. On the third floor, you will find bedroom linen, a toy store, a gym, and an ILA education centre. On floor 4 you can choose from a selection of restaurants. Finally you will find the cinema on floor 5 to catch a movie.  Currently, outside Vincom, they have a beautifully decorated Christmas tree that is very popular to take photos at.
		- „Éã„Ç∑„É¢„É™„Éß„Ç¶ (2.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Very modern plaza in Can Tho city but that all. I can't find attracted shop...
		- Van Ngo (3.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Grand shopping mall but few shops, wanna buy some baby clothes but there were just 2 shops and things were out of stocks. Gogi house was good.
		- Manuel Marcus (3.0‚≠ê, 2024-11-28): We were just in the Vinmart, nothing special just a supermarket. Prices are ok.
		- Daniel (3.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): It's OK, few mostly western stores with rather high prices, the only highlight was Aimee Cafe around the corner, one of the best cafes in the town
		- Hoang Nguyen (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Not bad for Vietnam. The mall is 5 stories high. On the top are the entertainment sections of games, movies, indoor playground. The basement is parking. Within the stories are clothes, restaurants, toys, electronics, cosmetics, and supplies. The mall is very clean. Even the bathrooms.
		- Alex Tan (3.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Just as clean as other Vincom buildings. Short of better branded shops. Anchor tenant not impressive. Need more varieties of latest fashion. Area around can have more stalls to attract more crowd. Weekdays evening are quiet..
		- X N (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): A nicely airconditioned place to walk around. However the place is very quiet so any sales people around will make you their target to get a sale from you. Other than that they have a variety of shops and the restaurants offer nice food. Very conveniently located near Vinpearl hotel so it's just a short walk over.
		- Ki·ªÅu Anh H√† (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): The view is the reason why u should come here
		- Carlos (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Good place for shopping. Food options are quite good. Inside the mall is a bit cold, but it‚Äôs good to cool down from the hot weather outside.
		- Francois Wolff (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Good place for window shopping or if you look for something particular and not "fake". Some shops are a bit overpriced, the small playground in the park nearby is great for young kids ! :)

		- The Green Dragon - R·ªìng Xanh (3.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): An expensive shopping mall with lots of shops to visit a cinema at the top floor resteraunts on the floor below it then shops below that and underground parking, the staff are nice and the security always opened the doors, however the food on the floor below the top was expensive and not worth the money paid.
		- Bao Ngo (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Clean and nice place to shop. Just like western shopping malls, prices are high and aimed at the wealthy and tourist trade.
