		- M K2901 (1.0⭐, 2024-06-30): You should review the staff's attitude. At other branches, the staff doesn't have such a bad attitude. I went twice and was not satisfied.

		- Anhhao Xa (1.0⭐, 2025-03-31): The staff shows an attitude of disrespect to customers, acting like they don't want to sell during the season
		- Võ Phạm Phương Thùy (3.0⭐, 2025-03-31): Service quality will be better if the gentleness in communication does not only come from the customer.
		- Tấn Trần (1.0⭐, 2024-10-31): The staff has an unfriendly attitude towards customers. I didn't bring my phone to deduct points from the app, but when I read the phone number, the staff refused, while the staff at Binh Thuy bhx agreed.
		- Châu Toản (5.0⭐, 2025-01-31): Enthusiastic support staff, on-time delivery
		- Cong Hoang Thach (4.0⭐, 2025-01-31): Convenient when shopping
		- Truong Quoc (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The meat and fish salesperson was not enthusiastic... That girl was illiterate, she asked many times to show her mercy, and it was difficult to hear her...
		- Yuki Pham (2.0⭐, 2024-03-31): I went to BHX in my hometown of Tra On and the security was very good. There is only one parking lot, but when you enter, it will help you park your car neatly, and when you come back, you will take the car without needing to be reminded. As for the store in Mau Than, there are 2 security guards who come in and find a parking space and drive the car themselves. The security guard just sat and watched. Some days you don't even give the ticket.
		- Kim Ngan (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Enthusiastic staff. Reasonable prices with many incentive programs for customers
		- Trúc Thanh (1.0⭐, 2022-03-31): The service is really poor. Every day the manager comes home, he is as considerate as the employee's other personality. I didn't bother to answer when I asked him to chop the food, but when I asked him to chop the food, I was dressed in a pile. When I went in to ask to wash my hands, I threw the scissors away. :(( I don't understand, BHX served much better back then.
		- Hồng Nhi Nguyễn (3.0⭐, 2023-03-31): There are many goods, located right on the street, easy to find, reasonable prices, not many sales, some sales are few and most are short-term goods. Food bought and processed is ok. If you like my review, please go to my youtube channel to support me, thank you very much!!!!!
		- Sói Ken (1.0⭐, 2023-03-31): At around 8:30 p.m. on February 24, the male employee at the checkout counter had a very unpleasant attitude toward customers. Should reconsider.
		- Tư Lùn (4.0⭐, 2023-03-31): The staff pays based on their emotions and does not follow the order in which customers arrive at the counter. One female friend has a grumpy attitude when paying.
		- Duong Pham (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Clean, agile, but the staff's face is a bit taciturn
		- Khang Trần (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Fresh, quality products and enthusiastic staff
		- Anh (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Male cashier's attitude towards customers. Security guards bully customers, poor attitude
		- Tiến Anh (1.0⭐, 2023-03-31): The male cashier has a loud attitude when customers ask to pay by card
		- Bạch Lê (2.0⭐, 2023-03-31): There are not many goods, seafood and meat of all kinds are not fresh. Not an ideal place to shop!

		- Trinh Ngụy (5.0⭐, 2024-11-30): This place has a cute and friendly driver, BHX often has discounts on food, and sells many things, quite convenient.
		- Hà Nhựt Anh 15-11-03 (1.0⭐, 2024-12-31): The staff has an attitude towards customers, says bad things, and even raises their phone to try to take a photo of the customer, what does that mean??
		- Mỹ Kim Phan Thị (1.0⭐, 2024-12-31): The meat is full of fat 🥱staff attitude 🥱 …
		- Thanh Trúc Nguyễn (3.0⭐, 2025-03-27): The security guard is a bit stiff :))
		- Nam Phú Trần (3.0⭐, 2024-03-31): 1. Strawberry Sting energy drink 330ml yellow & red listed price on shelf 6,500VNDD/bottle Charge 11,100VND and 11,400VND/bottle (on green department store website, it says 10,500 VND & 10,800 VND) 2. The price of 1 kilogram of Bien Hoa yellow cane sugar is listed on the shelf as 33,000 VND and charged at 38,000 VND (on the Bach Hoa Xanh website, it is listed as 36,000 VND).  Record the correct price on the shelf to gain customer trust.
		- Thanh Khánh Nguyễn (5.0⭐, 2024-07-31): The supermarket is full of goods, fresh fruits and vegetables, and friendly staff
		- DMH (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): There is a security guard (sometimes wearing glasses) who has a less than friendly attitude when guests come and go. Hope BHX will consider and fix it.
		- VO THANH TUAN (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): I often shop here because it's convenient. I intended to rate it 5 stars but deducted a star because the security service here does not serve guests (picking up guests, receiving vehicles, etc.). I feel like there is an uncle who seems to be taking the initiative, not proactively guiding guests to parking spaces, vouchers, and not being welcoming. Not as good as some other BHX locations. Or give change of 500 VND or 1000 VND to customers using a small type of road. If so, I will pay the chart with this type of road, is it okay? See basic services like elsewhere in the system. There are many goods and the prices are also suitable.
		- Mộng Le (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Cut the pork and put it in a box to sell with the gourd. Bringing it home and cooking it with smelly pork always makes me throw away the whole pot of soup 🙏 The pork in this store smells bad …
		- Minh Khang Hà (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): I hope you can check carefully about the items that are on sale today. The tomatoes I bought today were bruised and sour.
		- Nguyễn Ngọc (1.0⭐, 2022-03-31): Is it crazy, repairs are done during the day, why do repairs at 1:00 a.m., are you planning on letting people around sleep or not?

reviews:
		- Sarah Lucasta (1.0⭐, 2025-03-31): It's very common to miscalculate the price of discounted products. Once, I won't mention it, but I bought the same item a few days apart and miscalculated it. Even though I was 10, thousands of miles away, I was forced to run down.
		- NT Đạt (5.0⭐, 2025-03-17): Enthusiastic security, friendly staff
		- minh shai8x (5.0⭐, 2022-03-31): Spacious parking lot, parking guards are happy to communicate. Dedicated service staff, cheerful and enthusiastic guidance and service. Many fresh agricultural products, fresh fish, many diverse cosmetic products to choose from, many attractive promotions,.... An attractive, fresh - delicious - cheap shopping choice for housewives.
		- Trương Đức Mạnh (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): I took out a 7k bottle of water to pay and was charged 15k. I was confused and the staff said "you got 2 bottles, one in your pocket, right?". Actually, just now I put a bottle in my pocket with my hand in my wallet to check the money, then I took the bottle from that bag to pay, not taking 2 bottles or stealing. Without asking clearly the situation, the staff charged 15k. After I gave my bag to check, it wasn't there. At this point, I still didn't apologize at all? Do you have eyes to see when you put it in your pocket but don't see it when you bring it out? Contempt for customers, extremely bad attitude! Try buying a 7k bottle of water but being accused of stealing, do you feel frustrated?
		- World kent Kim (5.0⭐, 2025-03-17): affordable price
		- HuyCuong HuyCuong (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): There are often buy 2 get 1 free promotions, so I often buy things here
		- Nguyễn Thành Lợi (1.0⭐, 2020-03-31): Management is incompetent. Just likes to scold employees when they are wrong. Why don't you gently guide the employee's mistakes? They will love their work more. The management's attitude should be reviewed. In order not to affect customers, it is uncomfortable to enter the store and hear the Manager scolding the staff like that. I hope the manager will review her attitude and adjust it. Customers buy products at BHX.
		- Quy Nguyen Thanh (3.0⭐, 2022-03-31): Convenience store, clearly listed prices, only the bill always includes an additional 500 VND..

I still have 5k left but I want to eat a hot fruit...I ran to the market and saw the fruit🍒 said can I sell it for 5k...the sister didn't say anything but went in, took a piece of paper, burned it, then walked around...saw it. So I went to the supermarket and saw this fruit🍒 so I took 2 fruits and weighed them to pay... suddenly everyone looked at them... what's wrong🤔🤔🤔

		- thuyvuong doan (1.0⭐, 2023-03-31): I have shopped at this branch many times, but today's purchase was very bad. I bought two items but the staff gave me change twice. The first time it was a change, I reminded them but the staff did not ask. It's still not right to make a mistake and give me a refund. I will not shop at this branch again because of the staff's attitude. Last time, there was an employee who reminded the others to do their work, but yelled and raised their voice, making it very annoying for me to shop.
		- resources (4.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Very wonderful!

		- Thai Van Luong (5.0⭐, 2022-03-31): Bach Xanh Supermarket is located on Tran Hoang Na Street, Hung Loi Ward, Ninh Kieu District, Can Tho City. At the supermarket, there are all essential items sold such as food, instant noodles, jars, pho, porridge, etc. Soy sauce, sugar, vinegar, pepper, onion, garlic, chili, vegetables and fruits such as cucumber, mustard greens, lettuce, pumpkin, squash, luffa, gourd, all kinds of meat and fish, etc. Serving the shopping needs of surrounding people.
		- Minh Quân (3.0⭐, 2021-03-31): Vegetables here during the afternoon rush hour are considered trash, tattered, a lot of vegetables are spoiled, and no one on the staff takes care of the freshness of the counter. The spinach leaves are rotten and damaged but are still left on the shelves for sale, and the raw sprouts are black. The security guard who keeps the car leaves the passengers free to park wherever they want, sitting and yawning.

		- Epic Treasure (1.0⭐, 2025-01-31): They sell real dogs, buy 1 get 1 free coffee bottles that are nearly damaged and are 50% off but don't give them away. Buying them is no different than buying old things that have almost passed their shelf life.
		- Bụi (4.0⭐, 2021-03-31): Location: TGDD's mini supermarket chain stores were first opened at the end of 2016 and are concentrated in suburban districts of Ho Chi Minh City following the strategy of forests surrounding the city. By the beginning of 2018, TGDD's "forest" had penetrated deeper into the central districts and all Bach Hoa Xanh stores were located in front of major roads of these districts. With the characteristic green color and the brand name written very large and familiar in the style of Mobile World and Dien May Xanh, it is really easy to find and recognize a Bach Hoa Xanh store. ￼￼ Design - space: As mentioned above, Bach Hoa Xanh's design is imbued with the mobile world with the main color green, representing the green color of fresh and clean foods. If compared with the Vinmart store, it can be seen that Bach Hoa Xanh is much wider and longer. The special thing is that this mini supermarket is spaciously designed and the glass doors look straight inside, creating a feeling of attracting buyers as if they were seeing products for sale in the market. This design is truly more sophisticated and scientific than other convenience stores or food supermarket chains. In front of the store is usually a large space for customers to park and keep their vehicles. When entering this mini supermarket, you will meet two employees in blue uniforms bowing at the checkout counter. This is also the area equipped with the most cameras with about 5. Besides this area, other areas do not have cameras so customers can choose and buy more naturally. There are a total of 4 aisles in the shopping area in which fresh products are usually displayed first, followed by dry products and then household and personal hygiene products. Fresh foods such as vegetables, fruits, fresh meat or cooking spices will be arranged on 4-tier shelves and placed in the center area, while household products will be displayed on 8-tier shelves and placed at 4 wall corners. This design helps buyers see everything the supermarket sells and creates comfort for consumers because of the airiness and spaciousness between the stalls. The supermarket also prepares some blue shopping carts for customers to use in case they shop a lot.
		- Đất Đẹp (4.0⭐, 2021-03-31): Enthusiastic staff, complete goods, spacious parking lot. Next door there is also Phuc An Khang pharmacy, very convenient
		- Tran Nguyen Dang Khoa (1.0⭐, 2024-08-31): The taciturn staff does not instruct customers to pay. The checkout counter has more than 4 seats, of which 3 counters have cashiers. Customers wait at the counter without staff, but the staff at other counters quietly count all customers before speaking :))). Also waiting to see what you guys do next. Oh, there's an employee nearby who just dialed the phone. Bad!
		- Ho Duy Phuc (5.0⭐, 2020-03-31): Enthusiastic service staff, fresh food, affordable prices, especially apples are very fresh and delicious!
		- Mhghg (1.0⭐, 2024-10-31): Everything was fine except for the rude and annoying security guard who came out to drive the car himself but was trying to break his neck by pulling the car around.
		- DUY NGO VU (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The staff was so unprofessional. There was a case of replacing printing paper and then reprinting invoices for customers, but they struggled all day and didn't even get it done. They didn't even ask if customers had accumulated points or not. I said I didn't need to print invoices and left. If I had waited any longer, I would have thought that the line would be so long from where I was to the warehouse that the employee wouldn't have finished the job yet.
		- Quốc Minh Nguyễn (5.0⭐, 2022-03-31): Spacious, clean, covered parking. Many items to choose from, cheap prices, fresh products. Guaranteed 5K for customers to shop 🛍. …
		- Hiền Nguyễn (5.0⭐, 2024-06-30): Fresh products, happy and friendly staff!
		- Cam Hong (4.0⭐, 2021-03-31): Green Department Store on extended Nguyen Van Cu street (across Hong Phat area) has enthusiastic sales staff, but sometimes when shoppers are allowed to buy goods at a discount, the staff doesn't advise until the shopper buys more and says the invoice has already been issued so they can't sell. There was a long time when I didn't buy anything anymore. I only bought necessary items online and when I paid in cash, I went to Vinmart.
		- Thanh Thế Lê (4.0⭐, 2021-03-31): Prices are a bit higher than outside, lacking many items compared to large supermarkets (you don't buy celery or cherries) but the staff are friendly and enthusiastic.
		- PhạmDuyKhánh (5.0⭐, 2021-03-31): Full booth. Enthusiastic staff. I like the wine and beer shelves the most, many types and affordable prices. Large parking lot.
		- Bích Tuyền (1.0⭐, 2024-09-30): Review employee attitude
		- Triều Dương (1.0⭐, 2022-03-31): Leave this price when calculating another price and then say let it go. Flip the qq and never buy things here again
		- Văn Dũng Trần (4.0⭐, 2024-06-30): Fresh food. Fine. Waiting in line to pay is a bit long.
		- Trạng Nguyễn (2.0⭐, 2022-03-31): Food prices during the pandemic season are still too high, buying a small gourd costs 25k.
		- Linh nguyen (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Enthusiastic staff and all kinds of goods
		- Tòn Ten (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Enthusiastic security guard. The space is too spacious.
		- Nguyễn Nhật Phi 02-10-03 (2.0⭐, 2023-03-31): To reduce the price but expired, the staff did not take it down so I bought it by mistake
		- Hoàng Tuấn Nguyễn (3.0⭐, 2022-03-31): Besides the staff's attitude, everything else is ok :)))
		- Toan Nguyen (5.0⭐, 2021-03-31): Wide variety of items..especially with quick discounts during the day.

		- Nguyen Duong Nguyen Bao Y-E K48 (1.0⭐, 2024-11-30): The new employee did not give me a discount
		- Fc Liverpool (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The staff said that they only accept payments in cash, swipe cards and Momo wallets, not via Zalo pay.
		- Cẩm Tú (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Reasonable price The image is for advertising nature of fresh hydrangea flower shop, 202 30/4 street, Xuan Khanh ward, Ninh Kieu district, Can Tho city
		- Hồ Bé Linh (4.0⭐, 2022-03-31): It's close to where I live so I find it quite convenient. The staff are enthusiastic and very careful. Because I rarely use plastic bags, the staff will usually separate and classify the goods into each bag. If BHX minimizes plastic bags, it's ok.
		- HUYỀN TRUNG TÂM NHẬT NGỮ MIDORI (4.0⭐, 2022-03-31): Convenient because it's located right at the beginning of the road, the thing I hate the most is the question 500, do you get sugar or chili? Well, why give customers a choice when they don't need it? But I've always wondered that 500 is always the same 10 times. If you need a lot of 500, you should go to the bank to exchange it and give it to the customer. Next time, the customer will give you 500 to avoid being offended. The staff is also easy to work with, it's a pity for me to ask for 500 all the time, but I hate it so I still ask....
		- Huu Trong (5.0⭐, 2022-03-31): 2 sisters go shopping
		- Duong Pham (4.0⭐, 2021-03-31): Good products, professional, convenient, good service. But there is a problem that sometimes there is no charge according to the queue. Those with the smallest queue are allowed to jump in first. If so, if there are 10 people in the queue, do you have to wait until all 10 people are counted even though you are the first in line?
		- Mid_yanho • (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Enthusiastic and friendly staff, fully furnished
		- thịnh tran (3.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Shopping service is okay, prices are a bit high compared to outside.
		- Lý HC (4.0⭐, 2022-03-31): Supermarkets often change cashiers, so they are slow in the checkout process. Everything else is ok
		- Nguyen Hong Duy Anh (4.0⭐, 2022-03-31): Convenient because it's close to home, but the most annoying thing is the 500 VND habit of packing sugar, even though I don't use it, I always have to accept it.
		- hiền nguyễn minh (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Going to Green Department Store is convenient for shopping for daily necessities and a variety of items

		- udvar nok (3.0⭐, 2020-03-31): Fish meat is more expensive compared to stores of a similar size. They also sell live fish. Fresh meat for measurement. Chicken legs, wings, breast. The cashier boy understands and speaks little English. Photography is prohibited in the store.

		- Thiên Link Link (5.0⭐, 2020-03-31): This place is good to buy something!
		- Nguyễn Thomas (4.0⭐, 2022-03-31): Ok
		- EVNSPC (3.0⭐, 2022-03-31): Normal
		- Lê Long Vĩ (4.0⭐, 2020-03-31): Ok
		- van hai le (1.0⭐, 2025-03-26): I bought the chicken a few times without any promotion to eat it, but it was dead chicken and had a terrible smell that needed to be reported.
		- trúc phương (5.0⭐, 2024-12-31): Enthusiastic staff, cheap food
		- Ngan DIEP (1.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Bach Hoa Xanh has poor environmental sanitation, the landfill in front of the store is super big but they did not buy more trash bins, the current bins are old and filled with overflowing water to rot. The landfill is huge and full of flies, so where is the FOOD SAFETY AND HYGIENE? Buy things at good prices to save money to go to the hospital?
		- Phuong Luu Van (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Good experience. I often shop here. The parking lot is spacious and covered so you don't have to worry about rain or sun. There are enthusiastic and polite car guards. The space inside has many booths but is arranged reasonably so it still creates a spacious and airy feeling for customers. Goods are very diverse, have many types, are displayed neatly and according to categories so it is easy and quick to find. There are often product discount programs such as % off, buy 2 get 1 for free, % off when buying the 2nd product.... Feeling comfortable when shopping because there is air conditioning so the air does not have too much odor and the floor is clean. Supermarket staff are cheerful and enthusiastic. The only limitation is the product's expiration date. Customers who come to buy should check the expiry date because the same type of product may have a different production date, sometimes some products have a few days of expiry date left.
		- Thu Nguyễn Thị (1.0⭐, 2024-07-31): There are suggestions for BHX Nguyen Van Linh CAN THO about the security guard as follows: July 3, 2024 1. Driving a car over a passenger's foot: I stopped when I saw the guy driving the car. He also saw me but still ran the car over my foot. If I had any suggestions, he challenged me to the manager's door. 2. This is not the first time this security guard has had a bad attitude Many times before, when I visited here, I also encountered a situation where this security guard pushed me to lead the car to another customer. He clearly knew he was pushing me but still did not apologize. BHX needs to consider and find a solution
		- Mai Minh Vinh (5.0⭐, 2024-04-30): The staff is very cheerful, good service, cute. It's just a crime that it's far from where I live, but I like the service here and will come back when it's convenient
		- Việt Huy Châu (5.0⭐, 2024-04-30): The staff is enthusiastic, dedicated, and dedicated. The security guards are very polite and polite. Running many interesting karma activities is very attractive. Satisfied, very satisfied.
		- Tran (1.0⭐, 2025-01-31): Buy a bunch of spinach with all the damaged leaves
		- Tùng Cao (1.0⭐, 2024-08-31): A place that sells food has an unbearable stench of dead rats
		- Yến Nguyễn (1.0⭐, 2024-07-31): Fraudulent business. Price 28 + 40% off. But when calculating the money, it turned out to be 33k
		- Toàn Nguyễn (1.0⭐, 2024-04-30): Employees are technologically illiterate and, frankly, blind about incentive programs of banking sites
		- Vuong Oanh (5.0⭐, 2022-03-31): Address selling reputable and quality treadmills in Can Tho
		- Mac Dương (1.0⭐, 2021-03-31): The staff did not pay attention, causing me to buy a bottle of water and go to the cashier first and be charged later. I took this photo randomly in front of the store, but the security guard was very polite.
		- Thanh Bình Nguyễn (4.0⭐, 2021-03-31): Space like other places. The arrangement of some shelves is not reasonable, causing confusion for buyers. Some essential and basic products are still missing or 1 or 2 types and 1 or 2 products are on the shelves. If you don't care about price, this may be an option for you.
		- Thanh Tuoi Thai (4.0⭐, 2022-03-31): Nv nc serves well Just need to comment, the discount item has been sold out for a few days but the promotion has not been removed. Down, when I bought it, the seller didn't have time to explain it, but I bought it from ct down to Thanh and had the same problem. (partly due to my carelessness)
		- Tính Phan Văn (5.0⭐, 2021-03-31): Crowded but service quality ok. I asked the employee there, even though it was crowded, but she still came to show me what was on the fruit and vegetable counter
		- Phú Lê (4.0⭐, 2021-03-31): Sells a lot of fresh vegetables and tubers, service is also good, if there is a place to park a motorbike I would give it 4 stars, if there is a place to park a car I would give it a 5 star.
		- Hùng Lưu (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Spacious and airy parking lot with diverse goods, especially discounted goods up to 50%.
		- Tuyền Trần Mộng (1.0⭐, 2021-03-31): I went in to buy ground meat (just over 200gr) and a bottle of shampoo When weighing the meat, the staff put the shampoo bottle on the scale (more than 400 grams). Then scan the code of the individual shampoo bottle When I received the invoice, I realized something was not right I just came back and asked the cashier (Warehouse Staff) to weigh the ground meat again. Then she discovered that she had calculated the bill wrongly Finished charging again, but did not give the invoice back I also did not receive a single apology from you Since expansion. Saw very poor staff attitude
		- Quoc Tin Nguyen (2.0⭐, 2022-03-31): Turning on music is like punching customers in the ears. Visited the store at 4:00 p.m. when it was hot and humid but was given music like a bar. Can you reduce the volume of the speaker in front of the store? It's really noisy
		- Nguyễn Thị Kiều Tiên (4.0⭐, 2021-03-31): Lots of food and time to choose, the cashier and security staff are quite cute and enthusiastic. However, some other employees talked loudly among themselves, not being able to distinguish between the market and the supermarket.
		- Ngôn Bách Nhật (4.0⭐, 2020-03-31): The food and seafood industry is still small. There are things that have been out of stock for almost a week and I still don't want to buy them again. Polite staff.

reviews:
		- 01.Thúy an 6A6 (5.0⭐, 2022-03-31): Ok
		- van trinh (1.0⭐, 2024-10-31): Staff often mix up bills and prices. This bill was billed to someone else, I had to pay a few hundred for someone else's bill and only then did I find out when I got home . Each time I buy a lot of things, it's difficult to check the bill on the spot when it's crowded. When I'm paying, I also check the bill on the spot and it's missing. When I get home, I check again to find out, so even if I bring it back, I don't know how to calculate it. Buy a few stalks of onion to check for nearly 1kg of onions, buy a few small stalks to count for more than half a kilo, a handful of cilantro costs nearly a hundred thousand. Staff is very careless. The bill display screen is not as clear as Winmart's. I've had it happen to me many times, so I'm sure many other people have had it too. Ladies, be careful to check your bill, even if it's crowded, don't worry about losing money unfairly.
		- Mai Lan Hoàng (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The supermarket is cheap and serves quickly, but you should check carefully because there are many products that are close to their expiration date and can cause stomach upset when eaten, and the cold storage system is not very good.
		- Trí Nguyễn Thiện (3.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Goods are relatively complete, employees are cheerful and friendly Parking a car is also easy, motorbikes are guarded by a hospital
		- TUẤN KHẢI LÊ (4.0⭐, 2024-08-31): It's ok
		- Phuong Nguyenngoc (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): I have gone shopping many times at Bach Hoa Xanh supermarket, the vegetables are very fresh and the meat is abundant
		- Nấm Đông Cô (3.0⭐, 2020-03-31): _ Green department supermarket is a professional supermarket system. _ Currently there are 938 chain stores nationwide. _ Green Department Store, Dien May Xanh, Phan Khang belong to the mobile world group. _ I don't know if I'll add any more chains tomorrow. _ Can Tho currently has 35 stores spread throughout Can Tho city, the most located in Ninh Kieu district. _
		- Ngọc Diễm Phạm (5.0⭐, 2022-03-31): Products are more diverse than Vinmark, and prices are softer than Vinmark. I often go to the supermarket to buy food rather than go to the market, but when I go to a big supermarket, I'm too lazy to park my car, so I choose Bach Hoa Xanh as the best choice for me. The staff is also very enthusiastic and cheerful, much better than Vinmark.
		- Trăm Phạm (1.0⭐, 2022-03-31): The attitude of the security guard and payment staff is not good, I don't like the attitude towards customers at all. After buying it, I feel frustrated inside.
		- HuynhAnh Phung (4.0⭐, 2021-03-31): At the store, there are not enough products like on Cua Bach Hoa Xanh's website. Price is still higher than go or market

		- Ngọc Mai (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The unenthusiastic security guard did not lead the customer's car but stood and watched. 1 star rating is lucky. Because it's close to the apartment, I just came in to buy it. I'm very angry because every time he drives the car himself, the security guard always stands and watches.
		- linh van (2.0⭐, 2024-08-31): The female staff had an unpleasant attitude towards customers when paying. I felt like they were begging, not the customers.

		- Thanh Chính Võ (2.0⭐, 2024-12-31): The staff put fresh food together with old vegetables and milk, and the blood from the raw meat flowed out and became sticky. The chubby employee wears glasses.
		- Hahah (1.0⭐, 2024-10-31): On October 10, 2024, in the afternoon, we went in to buy a bottle of mineral water and a bottle of lemon oolong water. When we came to pay, a male named Huy charged us. He was quite rude towards us. He said it was 25k and then looked at the male next to him. Oh, I didn't ask for it. That's the attitude. I also work in service and Huy also works in service. Have you ever been so rude to your customers? I hope Huy and the green department store. at alley 132 Hung Loi 3/2 to retrain its staff so that the store will not be affected.
		- Peter Tran (5.0⭐, 2024-11-30): A place where shopping is frequent, convenient, and rich in goods,

		- ngọc hà nguyễn (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Buy 1000g apple and get 500g free but when you weigh it, it's only 1200g but the person says 1500g
		- Lê Trâm 01-01-01 (1.0⭐, 2023-03-31): I had a bad experience shopping here. I've always bought here before, but every day the staff is lovely, gentle and dedicated. Yet at 7:30 p.m. on April 1, 2022, I met an unfriendly employee who yelled at customers when they couldn't find the item they wanted to buy. When I paid, she raised her voice at me, wanting to argue. Hand in hand with customers while I talk very softly and slowly, I will never go to Banh Hoa Xanh again.  (That employee is wearing a blue and yellow shirt, could be the manager but doesn't have a name tag)
		- TRỊNH THẾ ANH (4.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Diverse goods meet all buyers' needs, prices are quite reasonable, spacious and airy, service staff is quite good.
		- ga con (1.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Today, April 4, 2022, I made a purchase at BHX alley 132, 3/2 street and felt dissatisfied, specifically as follows: I went to the vegetable counter and saw that the vegetables were wilted, so I removed the wilted part and the staff (cum car keeper) has an attitude of talking nonsense and not respecting customers. I said "I buy fresh food, but I don't buy wilted food", but I was told "If you buy fresh food, you should stand there and pick the wilted leaves too". It's the customer's right to spend money to buy food, but who buys wilted food to eat???
		- Tùng Lê (4.0⭐, 2022-03-31): The supermarket is in an alley but quite big, but the vegetables are left outside so they look more wilted than usual
