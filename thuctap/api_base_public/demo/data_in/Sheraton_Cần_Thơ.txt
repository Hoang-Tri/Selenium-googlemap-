		- Hendy Ongkodjojo (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): I stayed at the Sheraton Hotel in Can Tho with my family, and it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. The location and the view were amazing given the hotel's location along the river and proximity to city centre. The buffet breakfast was outstanding, offering a wide variety of fresh and delicious options including a variety of Vietnamese coffee options. The staff were incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, providing excellent travel tips, including a recommendation to visit Con Son Island (fish farm), which turned out to be a highlight of our trip. Their attentiveness made exploring the region so much easier and more enjoyable. Additionally, the laundry service was efficient, handled with care, and offered great value. From the excellent amenities to the personalised service, the Sheraton Can Tho exceeded all expectations and made our stay truly memorable.

		- Trip.com Member (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Stayed 2 nights. Its one of the most recognised landmarks in Can Tho. Room was spacious and clean. We got upgraded to a slightly better room with the river view. Hotel itself ls value for money and the service is great. Lots of staff around and ready to assist.
		- Son Nguyen (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Sheraton Can Tho: We have Platinum Elite status with Marriott Room: cleanliness 10/10. They offered early check-in, and were put in their top floor which oversee the Can Tho river. The view was spectacular. Services: we got treated really well. Breakfast was included in with Platinum Elite (full buffet breakfast) Location: it is right in the center of Can Tho City, very convenient to get around and explore the city. We highly recommend Sheraton Can Tho. THANK YOU!!!
		- Trip.com Member (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): The hotel is so clean, the workers are so professional and so friendly! They have so many things you can do in the hotel alone! They have free jacuzzi/spa/hot sauna in the spa floor that you can just go in anytime you want, they also have …
		- Wei T (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Club Food nice, service excellent for Ms Amy with her team. Good view, excellent service and good food. Club services will be one of tbe best choices for the visitation. The food is served with nice taste where the fish even dont have the bad smell. A worth place to visit.
		- Minh L (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): We had a wonderful stay at the Sheraton Can Tho. The staff was great and rooms were comfortable. |Service at the club lounge was especially excellent. The team there including Amy, Vivian, Thu, P. Anh, and Nguyen treated us all very well. …
		- Peter Treviño (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Our go to hotel in Can Tho for the last two years since it came under Marriott management.  The rooms are nicely sized with large bathrooms and floor to ceiling windows overlooking the Mekong river in many rooms.  The breakfast is an excellent option with lots of local foods and fruits.  The staff is always helpful and takes care of everything.
		- Trip.com Member (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Hotel room is big amd clean. Staff servicr attitude is very nice and polite. Breakfast is also decilious. Easy to access and place in town. Views outisde hotel room is beautiful.
		- Eoghan Miller (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): We had a great stay at the Sheraton. The room we had gave us a great view of the river. We were a short cab ride away from the walking bridge and waterfront. The Sheraton breakfast was fantastic.  The room set up was a bit strange as you had a clear view of the toilet from the bed. We also had dinner at their hotel but the dinner was just ok.
		- John Phan (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Sheraton Can Tho: Where Hospitality Shines Brightest ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ I've had the pleasure of staying at the Sheraton Can Tho twice in June 2024, and it has truly set the bar for exceptional hotel experiences in Vietnam. The staff's warmth and hospitality made me and my family feel incredibly welcome from the moment we stepped in. A special shoutout to Amy, the hotel supervisor, who went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. My kids absolutely adore her, and my daughter still talks about the wonderful lady who sang "Baby Shark" with her. It's those little touches that make a big difference. The breakfast buffet was a feast for the senses, offering an impressive variety of local delicacies, classic American breakfast options, and a delightful assortment of pastries. The staff's willingness to assist guests in getting their food was truly unique and added a special touch of personalized service. The concierges at the Lounge deserve a standing ovation. They were incredibly friendly and resourceful, engaging my energetic children in fun activities so I could actually relax and unwind. They truly embodied the spirit of Mary Poppins, making our stay even more enjoyable. Overall, my experiences at Sheraton Can Tho have been nothing short of extraordinary. The hotel's commitment to providing exceptional service and creating a welcoming atmosphere has left a lasting impression on my family and me. We can't wait to return next year for an even longer stay.
		- Arik Meyer (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Stayed for 5 nights and had an amazing experience. This place embodies what 5 star service is all about – a caring and truly exceptional approach to service.  Big compliments to the lounge team that made my stay wonderful.  Overall, highly recommended if you are in Can Tho!
		- Gemma Tran (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): We stayed here for 3 nights and it was overall such a pleasant experience.  Everyone was very professional and welcoming.  Our room was clean and well-equipped, offering a nice river view at night.  Shoutout to Quan who came by during our breakfast and gave us some great recommendations. Loved the breakfast selections as well - a good mix between Vietnamese and Western cuisines.
		- Trip.com Member (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): The hotel staff were kind enough to give us a room upgrade with river view! It was also a lovely gesture by the service staff to gift us a lotus soup dessert as return guests. The lobby was decorated festively for Xmas and the crew were impeccable in their service standard true to Sheraton brand! Enjoyed our stay once again
		- Goldis L (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): All is good, nice people, all the staff here is very welcome me. I like the team Anna, Jess and Derek on the 6th floor. They’re nice guys. They were always attentive, friendly and ready to help with anything I needed. Thank you all so much for serving.
		- Patrizia Mikaela Santos (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): The staff are super nice and let us check out late. They gave recommendations on what to do but they weren't pushy about it. The price is so good for the service we have received! The room was very spacious and lovely, I cannot believe we got it for the price we did, especially since this is Sheraton. The view was so nice too. Will definitely come back!!
		- Robin (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): I mean the hotel experience is standard across Marriott. However, the customer service for venue booking and weddings is subpar.  The hotel did not offer alternative options due to unfavorable weather conditions nor a partial refund. Overall, I recommend if you only wishing to stay as a hotel guest but I advise to find a different venue for event hosting.
		- Ma (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): From booking to check-in to leaving the hotel, everything was perfectly organized without any inconvenience. The Sheraton Can Tho is really a great place to stay, whether for business trip or for a relaxing holiday.  The room was spacious, modern and well-furnished. The bed was very comfortable and we slept very well (best and longest nights we had in Vietnam). I liked the attention to detail in the room. The windows offered great views of the city and river. The bathroom was clean and had a rain shower and good amenities.  The outdoor pool area was lovely. It's in a beautiful garden with lots of loungers. The pool was clean and well-maintained, a great place to relax after exploring Can Tho. The staff were very helpful, always ready to bring a drink or snack.  The Club Lounge was a highlight of my stay. The atmosphere was perfect for relaxing after a long day exploring the Mekong Delta. The evening cocktails and canapés were a great touch. The club lounge employees were so friendly and welcoming from the first day on.  The staff at the Sheraton Can Tho were attentive, professional, and went above and beyond to ensure my stay was perfect. I did experience a issue with the air conditioning in my room on the last night. However, after I reported it to the front desk, they immediately resolved the problem within minutes. The team even followed up with a call later to ensure everything was working fine and offered me a small compensation.  Overall, the Sheraton Can Tho offers a luxurious and comfortable stay with top-notch amenities and a genuinely hospitable team. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a refined experience in the heart of the Mekong Delta. I definitely would return on my next visit at Can Tho.
		- Amber H (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Amazing service, very clean, very attentive to your needs, beautiful food, Thoan was very friendly and helped us throughout our stay. They were also able to help us quickly get a taxi, and there facilities were very beautiful and frequently cleaned
		- Philippe c (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): strongly impressed by the service of the staff, very well trained, especially the Club Lounge, smart Anna, she gave me a very special homemade gift bag, opening the door to see off the guests shows her dedication to work. Because of her I will come back to Can Tho again
		- Paul Singh (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): An exceptional hotel. Rooms, facilities (pool, gym), food and above all the service were top drawer and rare. The location is also good overlooking the river, near some nice restaurants and a local market.
		- R C (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): This, along with the Sheraton Hanoi Hotel, are the best hotels I have stayed at in terms of service. When we first arrived the manager (Gao) greeted us and we had a friendly chat. Him and the gentleman at reception gave us restaurant recommendations, as well as a one day itinerary as we were only there for one night. The suite was clean with a beautiful view of the river, I regret not staying here longer as it was so luxurious and relaxing.  The breakfast buffet was one of the best we experienced, it was extremely well organized with top-notch service. All employees were very friendly, always smiling. If we’re ever back in Can Tho we would definitely stay here again.
		- David 霍 (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Best service I've seen in a hotel so far, comfy mattresses and pillows, convenient location, exquisite view, food is delicious, complementary products are high quality and fully supplied my demand. Overall, satisfied is an understatement, highly recommend checking this place out and would come here again if I have a chance|9.5/10
		- Mohammad Ilyas (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): It’s Amazing Hospitality from each and every staff members, they are up to the top above and beyond. It is my Second home, in Can Tho  And surprise gift for my Happy Birthday.
		- Scott Nguyễn (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Staffs are well trained, extremely friendly and helpful. When we complained about some renovation noise coming from nearby room, it was promptly addressed followed by an apology fruit plate. Breakfast was surprisingly delicious, I wasn’t expecting much from such a small city.  Only bad side is confusing hotel policy: seeing they promote having turndown service, we asked for it on the first night, that went great. The next night we asked for our room to be turned down again, reception said our room is not eligible. So why and how was it eligible in the first night? At this price point all Intercontinental hotels offer turndown service. What a shame for Marriott
		- Đăng Lưu (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Service and room decoration are not worth the price. Diner is fine. Spaghetti dish stands out among others. City view from 18th floor is not special the most.
		- Anchalee Nguyen (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): everything was perfect, breakfast was delicious, outdoor pool and had a good selection of cocktails, staff was very friendly I will be back in April
		- Trip.com Member (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Sheraton lives up to its reputation as a household branded hotel chain. The provision of service by each member of the team is akin to a well-oiled engine. Everyone knows their role and does it to the best of their abilties. The smiles and …
		- Giuseppe De Francesco (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): The service was extremely disappointing. Our group of 12 was required to pre-order our meals, and we arrived at the table promptly at 7 PM. Despite this, the dishes were served randomly and at a snail’s pace. Two members of our group had to wait over an hour and a half to receive their meals. The staff showed no professionalism, offering neither apologies nor any effort to address the situation. They appeared untrained and unhelpful, leaving us with a very poor impression of the establishment.
		- amie tran (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Amazing staff and clean comfortable rooms. As a Titanium Elite guests, I am impressed with the level of service received prior to check in and upon arrival. Amy Huynh and her staff at the club lounge exceeded my expectations on all levels of customer service (Beautiful, Kind, Proactive and Intelligent). I truly appreciate the hospitality here and the English proficiency of the staff is helpful for those who are foreign to Vietnam.  Location is great with the Mekong River running through the city. The hotel is next door to Vincom Plaza and for the thirsty adventurous tourist as myself desiring local cuisines, there are plenty around the vicinity without having to get a "Grab" bike or car.  This hotel stands out to me as they were so kind and accomdating to let me check in early (6am). I got off a 11 hour trip on a sleeper bus from Dalat to Can Tho and those who been on that trip will understand how wonderful and meaniful it is to a guest needing an early check in, especially one who has traveled over 104 days and counting this year! This hotel rise to the occasion and did not hesitate to get me a clean room to rest.  A sincere thank you to this hotel and the management team!
		- Gary Maseyk (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Appalling that the whole swimming pool area was out of bounds for wedding! And today it’s out of bounds for a concert! 35 degrees and we consigned to are rooms. Poor families with children! This Marriott hotel was sold to us highlighting the Swimming Pool. What joke. The wedding must have been booked for month, but no mention that we would get access to the pool area Booking.com and the Sheraton Can Tho. Shame on you. We wrote to Marriott customer support and they were not bothered.
		- Jasmine Bayliss (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): I have stayed at the Sheraton twice now. My family was impressed with it last year, so we returned this year and stayed for six nights. The staff, especially Huy, made my parents feel welcomed and appreciated. He was helpful with recommendations and helped me resolve a Shopee ordering issue. The buffet breakfast is spectacular and not to be missed. It remains my parents' favorite hotel breakfast out of all the five-star hotels in Vietnam where we stayed. The rooms were clean and well-maintained. The only negative I can say about the Sheraton is the location. We expected the riverwalk to be completed as it was still under construction during our visit last year. However, while the walkway is complete, portions are gated off, so you cannot walk from the Sheraton down to Ben Ninh Kieu. The riverwalk was also littered with dog droppings. Thankfully, Grab is inexpensive, and it is a quick ride down to the pier.
		- Trip.com Member (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): This hotel actually amazed ob how tidy and clean it is. A real 5 star hotel. From the first minute, the staff is welcoming and very friendly all the time smiling! The stay was extremely pleasant and the staff were very helpful. We enjoyed …
		- Trip.com Member (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Hotel was amazing, nice ambience, very professional and friendly staff. I enjoyed my 2 nights stay there very much and will definitely return to stay at Sheraton Can Tho if i were to revisit this town again.
		- Trip.com Member (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Great place to stay in can tho . Breakfast  is good . Location is ok . It's new hotel so still clean
		- Carolina Slingshot (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Amy - The Marriott staff on the sixth floor is the best.Club Lounge  She is so nice and warming.  Must visit the  Members club room !!  Plus steam room sauna, and pool was great too !!!
		- Konstantinos Psychogios (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): The staff is great but otherwise this is as soulless a hotel as you would expect a Sheraton to be. The rooms are very big and the beds very comfortable.
		- Stephen Lu (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Beautiful hotel Clean and has all the facilities Great value, the pick of the hotels in Can Tho Would have liked the mini bar to be stocked up more.
		- Victoria Tran (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Beautiful hotel. Amy at the club lounge is amazing! Thank you Amy  for going above and beyond to help me prepare a birthday amenity for my daughter who is traveling with me. I appreciate your extra effort.  Breakfast is delicious, tasty and nicely presentation.
		- SuperBadromeo (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Beautiful hotel , I always stay here every time I come Can Tho . Absolutely, recommend this hotel to everybody!!!
		- Huy Nguyen (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): This is our fourth and final visit to the Sheraton Can Tho, having first stayed when it was under Vinpearl management. At that time, we were highly impressed as it aligned well with the standards of its international counterparts in terms of service and presentation.  We have always been happy to the Sheraton brand, consistently choosing their hotels as our preferred option when traveling, including Sheraton properties in Gold Coast, Melbourne, and Marriott.  Unfortunately, during this recent stay, we were left with the impression that the focus has shifted towards maximizing revenue, rather than maintaining the quality of service we expect from a 5-star establishment. When booking through Agoda, we believed that the two rooms we reserved accommodated three adults each, with breakfast included. However, we were disappointed to find that additional charges were required for the third person and breakfast, on top of the premium Sheraton rate.  A 5-star hotel should not operate like a budget hotel, where guests are charged extra for amenities that should be included. This experience is unlike any we have encountered at other Sheraton properties worldwide, making it particularly disappointing that it occurred at the Can Tho branch.  Regrettably, this will be our fourth and final visit. Farewell, Sheraton Can Tho—you will not be missed.
		- Yi Han Ng (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Had an awesome stay in Sheraton Can tho. Staffs working in Mekong Restaurant were extremely friendly. Special shoutout to "Ka" for being hardworking, consistent in providing good service and made my dining experience there outstanding . Their Bahn Mi is undoubtedly one of the best I ever eaten in Vietnam. Thank you everyone.
		- Trip.com Member (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Great hotel . New and clean . Nice breakfast  and staff. All in all highly recommended
		- Nancy Nguyen (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Luxurious hotel in the delta with tremendous staff! Must stay if you are in Can Tho.
		- Kazuhiko O (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Good hospitality!|I sometimes stay for businesses trip in this hotel.||Thank you , Anna san at Club lounge.
		- Min Min (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Friendly, cozy, polite and lovely people of this hotel. Good for stay and food preparation is thoughtful.
		- Mark Males (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Just a regular premium hotel, no stand out features or experiences.  Looks nice in the pics but really isn't anything fabulous.
		- Claire Nguyen (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Excellent! Spectacular view from our room. Loved everything here. Staff are just awesome.
		- Dirk Mulder (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): We really enjoyed our stay here. Upon checking in, Suong was very hospitable and gave us a room upgrade. The pool was very nice and the rooms were spacious.  Special thanks to Khoa from the bell team, who made us feel very welcomed.  Highly recommended hotel!
		- Trip.com Member (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): The hotel is located near the riverside next to a very nice mall with a lot of shops and savory restaurants and a supermarket. It was love at first sight with this hotel. From the reception, to checkin. The hotel building is the tallest one …
		- Trip.com Member (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): There was a smokey smell when we entered our room however because the hotel was 99% full, they could not change our room. Other than that our stay was good.
		- Kellie (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Experiencing the hotel's name change without prior notification was inconvenient for some guests abroad when invitations had already been sent. Especially as it necessitated reprinting the wedding invitations. We proceeded with an outdoor wedding. Despite the unexpected rain, the situation was manageable. Overall, the service provided was satisfactory.  I want to extend my gratitude to the lovely and professional service staff, as well as to Manager Ken for his professionalism and friendliness.
		- Jenny Tran (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Excellent service, very warm welcoming from staff and manager, super comfortable bed, new hotel with excellent view to Mekong river. The hotel is located same with shopping mall and restaurants. Highly recommended!! Good value of price
		- Deborah Cornland (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): This is a very comfortable hotel with friendly and helpful staff. My only hesitation to giving it 5 stars is the acoustics in the main restaurant where breakfast is served. It is a large room dominated by hard surfaces that amplify and bounce noise, which makes it an unpleasant environment. This could be fixed with acoustical treatment on the walls.
		- Trip.com Member (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Excellent location, easy to move around. In the evening, remember to allocate time for dinning or drink at the pool side and enjoy the beautiful view of Can Tho city.
		- Rio Wang (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Probably the best hotel in this city for now and at a fairly central location.
		- Tereza Šmajsová (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): One of the best hotel stays I ever had. All of the staff was just super nice and attentative. The price is good. Special thanks to receptionist Amy, she was very helpful all the time, she even remembered our names and room number. The breakfast was amazing and hotel room spacious with a wonderful view of the city of Can Tho.
		- Colin Yeo (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Excellent service, room and facilities. Really enjoyed my stay. I really love the spread of choices including Vietnamese cuisine for the breakfast, comfortable firm pillow and mattress.
		- D Sundance (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Spend afternoons here to chill out on pool deck, swim, relax, and enjoy views of the city. Staff are super attentive and friendly. There are many loungers and umbrellas around the pool area, super soft towels provided, and shower facilities. There is a varied menu of food and beverages  available that you can eat poolside or on tables scattered around. At night, it transforms into a beautifully lit setting with a great chilled out  ambience.
		- Julie Dang (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): We stayed here for 7 nights so that we could travel to Bình Minh to visit my grandma and relatives. Initially we thought that 7 nights was too long but after a few days, we didn’t want to leave. The room was spacious, overlooking the city and the river. We checked in just as the sun was setting - it was beautiful! Every surface in the room was clean and spotless. I really have to commend the cleaning staff here. It is probably the first time that I’ve seen a hotel room cleaned so meticulously!  The staff at the hotel are so warm and friendly. They greeted us with lovely smiles every time we arrived back from a long day of visiting family. The facilities at the hotel were amazing. The gym was spacious and had enough equipment, the pool was big with a lot of sun beds and the spa services were so relaxing.  The hotel is also located in a great area. It is close to a lot of shops and restaurants. We loved spending time in the hotel. The pool staff were so attentive - especially Phát and Phác, they were so lovely and made sure all the guests were being looked after.  I can’t wait to come back to this hotel!
		- Vuca Tran (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Great customer service and clean room. Would definitely come back here.
		- Malizan Zakaria (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Every thing was good, from receptions, room set up & breakfast restaurant. The buffet spread is not so lavish as other 5 star hotels but acceptable. Restaurant Manager Trung very good & went extra miles to arrange some action station local delicacy without meat or pork as I’m Muslim. However some staff unable to speak English which the hotel needs to pay extra attention into English classes.
		- Selena Robinson (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): First of all, the staff and service were excellent.  Also courtesy and professional.  This is most likely the best and tallest hotel in Can Tho. The breakfast buffet is must if you have time in the morning. The room and bed was very comfortable and great amenities! This hotel is next to a litter mall too. There is a beautiful pool on the 6th floor. I am glad that I b9omed this Marriott Bonvoy property. The Sheraton is part of this hotel group
		- Trip.com Member (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): I recently stayed at the Sheraton Can Tho and it was an absolutely amazing experience. The hotel rooms were spacious, clean, and beautifully decorated. I felt like I was staying in a luxurious retreat with all the amenities I needed.The …
		- Q Nguyen (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): i want to make sure that this is the FIRST thing on my review, Huy was super sweet and kind!! made great convo with my grandma and helped her with getting in and out of our car! room was super spacious and fancy!! my family got two rooms and great view from either side of the building! the location is super close to everything which makes going places easy. we took a golf cart kind of car around can tho and the concierge helped us get one!! the water pressure was also very nice in the bathroom which is something i look for! lastly, the breakfast buffet was DELICIOUS! they offer different tropical fruits that are native to vietnam and a mixed amount of dishes from different cultures. all of the employees were super nice and eager to help aswell. they seemed to enjoy their jobs, which is a great thing. thank you for the phenomenal service and thank you to Huy for being so so sweet and helpful!
		- Doan Truong (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Amazing hotel!!! Everyone was very friendly and welcoming. The F&B manager Châu Kiến Quân came by and we had a wonderful conversation about the food at the hotel. I have to say, the breakfast buffet is one of the best I have ever tried. Every thing we ate was exceptionally delicious. The pho ga and pho bo were so delicious. I can’t recommend this place enough, in fact, this will be the de facto hotel I will be staying at when visiting Can Tho.
		- Larry Frakes (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Great staff, wonderful room, and a buffet breakfast that's second to none.
		- Trip.com Member (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): The recent stay at the Sheraton Can Tho was a very pleasant one.  The hotel restaurant food was fantastic, especially the Kho Fish, It was so good.  Everyone from the waiting staff to the restaurant manager was very friendly and helpful, especially Wendy, she was very nice and helpful.  Will stay here again next trip to Can Tho.
		- C W (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Wonderful stay at Sheraton Can Tho for our visit of Mekong River.  The hotel staff are very helpful with arranging transportation from Ho Chi Minh and to Can Tho airport. Staff speak good English. They are very polite.  The selection of food and drink at the breakfast buffet was amazing.  Room was spacious. We enjoyed our stay very much.
		- Thắng Vũ Ngọc (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): We had a memorable stay at Sheraton Can Tho although we only stayed for one night, thanks to the superb services from all service staff. Sheraton Can Tho deserves an excellent rating and is highly recommended. This hotel is now our top-choice for accomodation whenever we visit Can Tho. We will definitely come back and stay longer.
		- Trip.com Member (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): A shopping mall is nearby with coffee shop and other stores inside. Hotel room is clean and big, different choices for breakfast, big swimming pool, front desk staff is polite with good working attitude. Will definite come here again in the future.
		- Anh Nguyen (Jerry Nguyen) (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Excellent service!  Not staying but went inside the lobby for a coffee while watching World Cup and gotta say I really did enjoy it!  The place is exquisitely clean, comfy and very well-decorated.  The latte' I had was exceptional, fragrant and rich taste; the cake was just as amazing!  I had both of them on a promotion combo of 99k, otherwise also very reasonable prices for the quality of service received even if the promotion wasn't there. Staffs were very nice and welcoming guests.  Will for sure coming back
		- Vegard Wynn (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): We love the breakfast. It is very tasteful with authentic local cuisine. Thank you miss Amy for wonderful service at arrival and check out with very sweet and professional. The suite is pretty, cleaned and heartbreaking view of Can Tho city. Thank you
		- TheEngineer Nguyen (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Disclaimer:  We do not receive any financial compensation from “Khách sạn Sheraton Cần Thơ” for this review.  Moreover, we are not professional “Hoteliers”, and the review is resulted from the actual experience. We will review the hotel in three areas: Facility/Room/Breakfast, Location and Service FACILTIY/ROOM Khách sạn Sheraton Cần Thơ is best described with two words “well-managed”.  It is the only visible sky scraper from the distance as you are entering the city limit. Its only competition is Azerai Can Tho which located on a tiny river-island.  Because of its isolated landscape, Azerai Can Tho may not be a worthy competitor for Sheraton Can Tho. The room décor, bed comfort and space is on par its peers back in the United States.  The view of the city and the river from the room is spectacular. The gym is decent and on par with its peers. Breakfast is a buffet with a good mixture of Westerns and Asians. Noted – many Vietnam high end hotels supplement its income with domestic tour groups.  Noises late into the night and at breakfast can be a deal breaker for international visitors. We booked 3 nights on the weekend and personally experienced a mixture of 3 types of guests, loud tour groups, high school field trip students and city business groups mingled with local politicians. On our first night, we were awaked with loud talking guests at midnight; noted that the issue is promptly resolved the next morning with front desk staffs. LOCATION The hotel is strategically on the newer section of the city development.  It is a 10 – 15 minutes to a nearby traditional market. You will still need a motor bike for exploration of other interesting areas of the city. SERVICE Vietnam is slowly moving away from “OPPORTUNIST” economy base society.  It is very challenging to train employees to do their job and keep to themselves without fishing for “OPPORTUNITY” from the hotel guests; although, we did experience an up-sale from one particular dining staff. Customer service is where Khách sạn Sheraton Cần Thơ  shines.  The hotel has a good management team.  All employees are well trained.  Most will speak enough English for their particular job responsibility; and most importantly keep to themselves in present of hotel guests. Overall, we would give Khách sạn Sheraton Cần Thơ 4.5 out of 5.0 rating for its value and price of 3 nights experience of stay on 5/10/2024, 5/11/2024 and 5/12/2024.

		- Kamala Nguyen (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Excellent location in the city , Very nice welcome, room has nice view, very nice bed make up, great breakfast ( especially fresh juices and beef noodles). BTW they need to improve the shower water temperature go up and down. 5 start hotel they will set up fresh fruits in the room normally, but our room hadn’t. We stayed 3D 2N.
		- Jay Tran (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): As many others have said this is likely the best hotel in Can Tho. The rooms have a classic style but does not feel dated or worn. Corner room had a nice view of the river  Pool is great and there are four cabanas that are available for use. Breakfast was good, there is a good selection of buffet and made to order dishes. This hotel is connected to Vincom mall which is another plus. Elite status recognized and early check in accommodated, welcome drink is a nice touch
		- John Stewart, Jr. (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): We stayed 3 nights at the Sheraton in Can Tho, and had a great stay.  Easy location, friendly and attentive staff, spacious clean rooms with amazing views!  Saw one of the most amazing sunsets from our room.  The breakfast buffet was very good with a wide selection of Vietnamese and western options.  Highly recommend the steak and eggs!  Cannot forget to mention the fresh rice noodle/crepe stations with both meat and vegetarian options!  The manager was very nice and recommended a local place to have dinner, we had some yummy hot pot with duck in a nice neighborhood with locals.
		- nga hoang (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): It just a brand Sheraton but it not up to Sheraton standards. Wi-Fi not working sometimes, low shower pressure. The hallway smells. The towels has smells. Slow elevator. They have private events at the pool. Stay away from it if peaceful is needed. The pool tile is falling apart. Overall it more like solid three star hotel.
		- Michaela Germany (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): AMAZING HOTEL This hotel has been part of the Marriott Group for two month now. We really liked the hotel. It is perfectly situated and the rooms are huge. It is an older Hotel but in very good shape. But most important, from each room you have an amazing view over the city and the Mekong River. The breakfast is very good. You have a wide variety to chose from. You can even have a coconut for breakfast. Besides the Asian options you get different kind of bread, cheese, sausage and egg dishes. The staff in the hotel is very friendly, motivated and service orientated. Even if not everybody speaks English, there is always somebody to help. The swimming pool is huge and it is very relaxing to spend time there.
		- Craig Bauer (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Amazing view from the clean, spacious rooms!  The staff have all been incredibly friendly and helpful.  Ive stayed at 5 different hotels in Can Tho and this will be my must-return-to hotel from now on.
		- Long Boc (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): The best hotel in Can Tho. Allow guesses to check in early. Very helpful and friendly staff. Nice view from the room. Great facilities including gym, pool, etc. Very comfortable staying here. Sorry I didn’t take photos when I first came, so  the photos kinda gross here. But it’s a great hotel. I will definitely come back next time. Highly recommended!
		- Saigon ClayArt (Millions Rose) (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Beautiful and elegant design, Sheraton  located on 30.4 street, easy to find. Just some steps to the yacht park, you can enjoy the time  in the Mekong Delta,  feel fresh with the nature atmosphere around,  5 minutes to walking bridge Room was spacious,  clean, comfortable bed with nice smell.  Variety to choose for breakfast, drink was good. Kindly service. Conferences room was huge,  professional looks. Oh, I love all these paintings 🖼  here.

		- Jyan Zárate (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Upgraded to club room as a gold member. Personally greeted by the GM during checkout and a beautiful candy display placed in our room while we went to lunch. Staff is top-notch and this hotel is a shining example of what a bonvoy hotel should be.
		- Ira (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Great place to stay in Can Tho. We got a welcome chocolate treat and a room upgrade. The service was excellent. The hotel staff were very professional. Breakfast selection is also great. Definitely will be back.
		- Julia N (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Room and amenities were excellent, great customer experience at the front desk/reception. Awesome location too! Unfortunately, we had a poor experience with one of the pool waiters. He was requesting a cash payment, stating he couldn’t put the bill to the room and said he would happy to send someone to our room if we didn’t have any. I refused but not something I would expect from a 5 star hotel.
		- Kevin Le (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Best hotel in Can Tho, you can't really miss it since it dominates the skyline.  Rooms are spacious and well equipped. Definitely up to Sheraton brand standards.  Breakfast buffet is top notch, a good selection of local and western cuisine. Staff were friendly and accommodating.
		- Trip.com Member (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Size of hotel room is big, breakfast is great with lots of different choices.Delicious local restaurants arr also nearby.A very good place worthy for staying when visiting Can Tho city.
		- Peter Clark (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): What an amazing Hotel. Word's cannot explain what effect that you get when you stay at this First Class Hotel. The hospitality is second to none and the staff make you feel welcomed whenever you walk through the doors. The breakfast will leave you picking your jaw off the ground. Rooms and view need to be seen to be believed. Cheers Clarky

		- Khai To (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Excellent hotel to choose when coming to Can Tho. My top choice whenever I have to visit Can Tho for work or leisure. You could have a wonderful view even night or morning time. Staffs are super nice and friendly. Breakfast is a plus for your stay in here. Khaitx review - Approved 5 star
		- Viravan Perumal (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Sheraton -Can Tho is a wonderful property, well maintained located in the centre adjoining the mall. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. Mr Du in the restaurant took extra care for us to have vegetarian dishes during our 2 night stay. Hats off to him.
		- Trip.com Member (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Great stay! Breakfast was fantastic, they had so much to select from. The room had a great view and was very large and clean. Staff were polite and helpful. This is a good place to stay with kids. The pool was very handy. Great little footpath seafood restaurant just across the road.
		- Nam Luu (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Wonderful service. Great ambience. The staff is cordial and speak English. The hotel and amenities are 5 star quality. Breakfast buffet caters to Western and Asian tastes.  The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. My favorite is the body wash, shampoo, and conditioner... smelling of Orange Cream Soda. After days of touring the Mekong... bliss.
		- James Mason (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Sheraton Can Tho Hotel is an exquisite oasis nestled in the heart of the picturesque Mekong Delta in Vietnam. My recent stay at this luxurious hotel left me with an unforgettable impression.  From the moment I arrived, I was greeted by the warm and hospitable staff, who made check-in a breeze. The attention to detail and commitment to exceptional service were evident throughout my stay.  The rooms at Sheraton Can Tho are nothing short of elegant and comfortable. With stunning views of the Hau River and lush surroundings, each room provides a serene escape from the bustling city. The amenities are top-notch, and the beds are so comfortable that I had some of the best sleep during my stay.  The hotel offers an array of dining options, including both Vietnamese and international cuisines. The breakfast buffet was a particular highlight, offering a wide variety of dishes to cater to every palate.  One of the hotel's standout features is its beautiful infinity pool overlooking the river, providing a perfect spot to relax and unwind. The fitness center is also well-equipped for those who like to stay active while traveling.  Sheraton Can Tho Hotel's central location makes it easy to explore Can Tho's attractions, including the famous Cai Rang Floating Market and the Can Tho Bridge.  In summary, Sheraton Can Tho Hotel is a luxurious haven in the heart of the Mekong Delta, offering impeccable service, elegant accommodations, and a range of amenities that ensure a memorable stay. Whether you're here for business or leisure, this hotel is a true gem that I highly recommend.
		- Mabel L (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Lovely five star hotel. Only thing of criticism is the weak soundproofing of the lower floor rooms. I could hear my neighbour’s speaker and she heard my mobile phone alarm. Loved the bathtub, view and firm beds. Very comfortable and the best rest you’d find in the area.
		- Amanda Navarro (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): We booked through Agoda but when we arrived booking had been cancelled as name of hotel had changed from Vinpearl to Sheraton. Lucky we could still get room at slightly higher price. Large rooms with high ceilings and amazing views of the Delta. Staff were  friendly and efficient. Breakfast buffet had a huge choice including fresh coconuts. Dinner was delicious too. I booked a massage and facial. The massage wasn't very good just up and down my back for half an hour no technique. She was much better with doing the facial very relaxing.
		- CJ McCoy (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Exceptional Hospitality Experience at Sheraton Can Tho  I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Sheraton Can Tho during a two-week trip to Vietnam with my Mom and friend. Our experience was nothing short of exceptional, thanks to the outstanding staff who went above and beyond to make our stay memorable.  The team at Sheraton Can Tho, particularly Du, Tien, and Huy from the lobby bar, demonstrated an unparalleled commitment to customer service. Their warm welcomes, attention to detail, and genuine friendliness created an inviting atmosphere that made us feel right at home. Whether we were seeking local recommendations or enjoying a relaxing evening at the bar, their hospitality truly stood out.  Our mornings were equally delightful, thanks to the impeccable service at the breakfast buffet. Tran and Huyen (Ka) provided exemplary service, ensuring that every meal was a delightful experience. Their genuine smiles and proactive approach added an extra layer of warmth to the dining experience.  The hotel also connected us with an amazing tour service of the Cai Rang floating markets.  The Sheraton Can Tho's commitment to customer satisfaction, as exemplified by Du, Tien, Huy, Tran, and Huyen (Ka), made our stay unforgettable. I highly recommend this hotel to fellow travelers seeking not just accommodation but an exceptional hospitality experience in the heart of Vietnam. A heartfelt thank you to the Sheraton Can Tho team for making our trip truly special.
		- Kemasta Genhiro (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Gorgeous view from room, supreme breakfast, western and local style, free parking, in town center. One of the best hotel I ever stay.
		- Đình Nhon Đậu (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): This hotel is so comfortable with nice view and good service. The staffs are friendly and hospitality in anywhere in hotel. Moreover, gym, swimming pool are available for tourists in any time.However, the buffet is not  really good enough for the tourists from the northern of Vietnam where people do not eat noodle or soup with sweet taste. In conclusion, i like it and 7/10 point for this experienced time at Can Tho city.
		- Yong Ting Lim (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Stayed as a Titanium Elite member and was upgraded to the Executive Suite on level 29. The front office Manager Mr Tuan personally greeted and escorted me to the suite room . Standard benefits for Elite members (lounge access, complimentary breakfast, late checkout). Based on his sharing the hotel is actually refurbished and then rebranded to Sheraton; it was under a local hotel chain before the pandemic. A pleasant welcoming vibe overall.  Breakfast buffet spread was wonderful - Asian style, egg stations, grill station, fruits, pastries and juices. Gym was well equipped. Service was impeccable. 5/5 will recommend.
		- Cam Heming (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): A classy place with huge rooms for a very reasonable price. The staff are great and the pool area is huge and lovely.  The view from our room was amazing.  It's so hot in Can Tho' they we had to move to the Vinpearl and loved it.  Not usually how we roll but was worth it.
		- Merritt (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): We had booked a room here to stay the night, but just relaxed in the lobby instead! The drinks were great and desserts and sides were awesome in the cafe.
		- Linh Diep (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Our stay at Vinpearl was great! From the minute you walk in through the doors, you're greater by friendly staff and a refreshing lemon beverage. The facilities are calming and clean. The rooms itself are spacious. Breakfast buffet there was a large range to choose from (both local and western dishes) and tasty too. Would happily go again!
		- detty isniaty (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Clean room, great location.. 1st time to Can tho. Special thanks to "Gia Luan", receptionist staff, for documents that i needed after business trip
		- JM (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Lovely room, spacious with floor to ceiling windows.
		- Loan Luong (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): 2nd time stay here for business trip and same good experience with Vinpearl Hotel. Room is nice and clean with really comfy bed. Staff is well trained, lovely and so supportive. They checked carefully and informed me that I forgot my blaze at closet; then they quickly brought it back to me. About breakfast buffet, it is really nice and tasty with many options. If you are looking for a place to stay in Can Tho even for business or leisure purpose, I highly recommend this hotel
		- Trip.com Member (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Special thanks to Yen Nhi! Everything was great!
		- Trip.com Member (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Good location just besides a shopping mall. Lots of coffee shops and restaurants nearby.Servcie from hotel staffs are also nice.Will visit here again definitely.
		- Tatjana Parac-Vogt (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Large rooms, beautiful pool area, and fantastic SPA. The stuff is incredibly kind and attentive. I got unwell while staying there and they took the best care of me. It felt like home. Highly recommended!
		- Trip.com Member (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Ummmm not good at all just top hotel in City because not have a lots in Can tho don’t mean good ….!
		- Peter Risberg (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Huge hotel with 30+ floors. Great view over the city from the upper floors. Vaste public areas so plenty of space although quite busy. Excellent service from all staff. Everyone decent in English. Room big and spacious, clean and well kept. REALLY great breakfast. Location of hotel fairly OK but in a non-tourist location so expect some walks or using taxi (Very cheap). We got a promo deal so excellent value for money. Even at standard rate it would still be a good deal.
		- Trang Pham (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): The room and the hotel itself is decent. The staff is absolutely amazing. We felt very welcomed from the minute we arrived and were well looked after during our stay. A massive thank you to Sheraton Can Tho team.
		- Viktoriya Zakharova (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Great hotel. Very luxurious. Great breakfast buffer. The staff was extremely accommodating. We forgot something in the room and they offered us to send it to Saigon as soon as they found it. Would happily stay here again.
		- Hung An Nguyen (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Stayed here 17 Aug (Room 2709). The room quality is good but not impressive as expected for a 5* hotel. The hotel has good location. Did not try their swimming pool, spa & fitness center. I rated 4 on the overall in stead of 5 due to the food quality (breakfast) and the hospitality is not as expected to its level. Maybe the hotel is new, processes & things are going to be improved.
		- James Bonello (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Best stay in town - highly recommended! Thanks to Mr Khoa from front desk for his kind assistance to  book the bus transfer.
		- Salathiel Noronha (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): I stayed all over Viet Nam and this hotel was my absolute favorite from a service stand point. I do have very high marriott status, but this hotel went above and beyond any marriott I've every stayed at including the ones in the U.S. The staff was incredibly friendly and took care of my private tour request with very little effort on my end. The general manager even came to meet me which has never happened before. I would stay here 10/10.
		- Pierre Camps (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): We came to the Mekong Breeze restaurant. The service was terrible, soup and appetizers weren’t brought till the end of the meal. Pasta tasted good but it was 98% noodles and 2% meat/sauce. Chicken fried rice, nothing special. My biggest waste of money so far in 2023.
		- fion liew (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Hotel staffs are helpful, and friendly. They always have smile on thier face.  Hotel facilities are clean and well maintained.  Hotel rooms are spacious and clean. The house keeping is always efficient and helpful.  We come here for holiday and also to enjoy our anniversary , so the hotel surprised us by a cake and nice decorations. Feel graceful for the arrangement.  Hotel breakfast selection is good and variety. Highly recommended the ice Vietnam coffee. I prefer hot coffee and without condense milk. But the staff here told me that It is the signature for the Vietnam coffee with ice and the condense milk.. I am good to try and like it very much. You may tell if you would like to have it less sweet. Staff in the restaurants are efficient so you will not feel messy as if the breakfast in buffet style.. The food in thechinese restaurant in level 6 is also yummy.. My family like it a lot. Overall... I return to have a relax trip again.
		- Derin Davis (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Very good service.  Polite and friendly staff.  Breakfast recommendations are perfect. Tapioca cake with coconut milk is awesome. Affordable price.  Thanks
		- kian wee chau (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): The hotel is new. My room was at 18th floor. Beautiful city view. The breakfast was buffet. Many varieties. Bath salt was also provided. The staff was friendly and helpful. One disappoints me is that the swimming pool opens from 6am to 7pm. I had no chance to enjoy it as it closes too early.
		- Quoc Bao (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Such outstanding experience here at Sheraton Cần Thơ. The staff went above and beyond to maximize our enjoyment staying here for our wedding anniversary, including preparing special decorations for us. Special thanks to Mr. Vuong Tuan and Lucas Nguyen for making this our memorial stay.  Great customer service, great location, and the best view of the entire city. What more could you ask for?  Thank you, Sheraton Cần Thơ!
		- Mục Du (Đi & Đi) (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): The first thing that Visitors come and see is the lobby area, peaceful space, fresh air, friendly service ... I like this space and especially the meal  Breakfast here, many dishes suit the taste ... the cafe is quite good.  This place is probably the place to experience modern living space, with the surrounding facilities .... this is the second time I chose this place for vacation and will definitely come back with Friends and Family many times.
		- Khoa “Kenny” Tran (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Customer and staff service was perfect. Our room has a lovely, great city and river view.
		- Trip.com Member (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Hotel room is clean, front desk service staffs are polite and friendly, breakfast is very delicious. Will definitely visit again.
		- Jenny (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Stayed at Sheraton Can Tho - the room was clean, spacious with good city views. The buffet breakfast was good - a lot of variety with highlight is their beef pho, bread roll & pate. The dinner at Mekong Breeze was ok but think you will get better value & taste if you explore local restaurants nearby instead. The only downside is the private car transfer service/price they offered us for a trip - very overpriced (close to 3 times more than typical rate) compared to other private car transfer companies. We trusted Sheraton to organise transfer that was competitive in price/service as coming from reputable brand but not delivered on this.
		- Ian Hood (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): We had a first class stay from check in on arrival to check out. A truly enjoyable stay. The room we were allocated on an upper floor with views over the river and city below was excellent. A really good size with everything we would need for our stay, free bottled water every day and even a few soft drinks in the fridge to get us started.  The bed was large and extremely comfortable and the bedding had a luxury feel to it..  The bathroom was also a good size with both a shower area and a bath, which I really like. (The shower did tend to leak water below the shower door.... this was the only little niggle in an otherwise perfect stay). The general manager even personally helped us choose a trip in the local delta which was much appreciated, the boat trip and afternoon cycle was very memorable. The front of house staff were all excellent and always offering assistance and a smile, particular mention must go to Ngoc Hang and the bell boy, Thai Hung who could not do enough to make our stay perfect and seemed to be there every time we passed the front desk, once again much appreciated. The pool was a welcome highlight, its a "huge" pool with lots of sunbeds always available, ideal to relax after a day out exploring. The buffet breakfast was a great way to start the day, huge choice of both Vietnamese and western dishes. There was so much to choose from one, of the best buffets we have seen on our recent travels. The market area is a short walk away and only a few minutes in a taxi for about 30,000 VND...... In summary we would not hesitate to stay at the Vinpearl in Can Tho should we be back in the area again, indeed it has made us think of booking further stays at the Vinpearl Group o our next visit to Vietnam. Can't wait to return.....  Thanks once again for the excellent service from all the staff.
		- steven Ng (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Been here in last year 27/June. and really loved our stay.so this year stay again  The hotel is very new and luxurious. We had a room 2903  on the 29 th floor and it was absolutely amazing. Good view over the Mekong. Rooms are very spacious and the breakfast was ama-zing! I would like to take the opportunity recommending this place!
		- Kathy Tran (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Well, I really like the way staffs and service team over here to help me as well as treat me. That is amazing time to stay here. However, I have heard most of them share that the corporation force them to pay a electric vehicle or make monthly payment to exist their job as well as their life. Hey! Please do not treat them like that because they are helping your property to get 5 stars and treat customer like me to feel as a King. I hope whenever this comment goes through, please read and pass them to be better. I think that I will recommend my friends or more than them to stay here, but never want to hear bad story from your employees sharing. I know it is not my business, but I am just afraid of loosing my life here once your employees get repressively by hotel benefits.
		- Steve Schroeder (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Unbelievable value for the amenities perfect area to explore from. Just superb accommodations for a Western travelers you will feel like you are at a 4.5-5 star hotel in a major US city, except close to the culture of Vietnam. Just wonderful
		- Anna Liu (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): I was staying on the 30th floor and this is the view. Extraordinary, right? Don't look for a window if you want to stay this high. The buffet is massive. I'm not a morning person but recommend you need to wake up early enough for this buffet. 😆 …
		- Alana Muir (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): This is not the best 5-star hotel I’ve ever stayed at. They could improve some things. However, it is 5 star. Our room felt luxurious. Breakfast spread really good. Really comfortable bed. Quiet rooms.
		- Son Tran (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Overall the property is good. Breakfast is nice with variety type of food. Room is spacious with fantastic city and river view, however the sound roof is not good. I was on 23 floor but still here the sound outside
		- Ri Ri (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): 本当すごかったです！A very wonderful place!It's very conviniently located in the downtown area with a mall built into it. It's about a 10 minute taxi ride a way from the main bus station thst takes you to and from Saigon. It's also next to the river with a beautiful view from the room. They serve you a welcome tea and the staff are all very friendly. They rooms are beautiful, neat, and smells good. The price is an excellent deal, only $60 USD. The gym is decent and the pool outside is really nice and big. I highly recommend this place if you want great quality for a cheap price.
		- Esther Mohan (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): This hotel is amazing! After a few days of backpacking, I just needed a hotel like this to relax. We were welcomed with a cold drink and we were two hours earlier, so they tried to fix a room for us. The rooms are wonderful, they have a great big bed, a flatscreen, a bathtub and an amazing view over the city. Breakfast was also very delicious and you'll have so many options. At this hotel you can also arrange your trip to Phu Quoc. We got to the ferry and they booked us VIP tickets! I enjoyed staying there.
		- Derya B. (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Can only say: This is a fantastic and luxurious hotel!  Service - excellent  Staff - friendly, welcoming and serviceminded  Room - spacious and with a great view of Can Tho (we were on 21st floor, amazing)  Spa & gym on 7th floor - great gym, better than most hotel gyms, and then the spa area (separate for women and men) with jacuzzi, sauna and steam bath. Very relaxing. Unfortunately the steam bath was out of order but i enjoyed the sauna after a great workout in the gym.  Breeze restaurant on ground floor - We had the set menu for two people, 700 ’ VND and we liked some dishes more than others, we would have loved more of the vietnamese flavours/tastes, some of the dishes were quiet boring and other nice. However the restaurant staff was very professional and had great service, also it was a lot of food, so you wont leave hungry!  Also there’s a tour desk at the entry floor if you want to take a tour to the morning-floating-market on the river.
		- Brandon Chau (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): I stay here every time i visit Can Tho, nice clean friendly staffs , i just love the hotel fell like my second home. The hotel is pretty central close to everything, shopping and food just right downstairs. I have had recommended this hotel to lots of people including family and friends.
		- Gabrielle Le (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): It was a great experience. My friends and I love it: the larger than average bed room with very comfy bed, pillows, the nice/friendly/polite staffs, the great breakfast buffet; we definitely will stay there again.
		- Lina Ottosson (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): The low service, comfort and level of entertainment at the hotel were not good enough for a 4 star hotel. The overall score is improved by the nice pool area, the gym and tasty room service food.
		- Viet Pham (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Two-year comeback: Vinpearl transforms into Sheraton with many improvements. However, one issue remains: the Internet WiFi still experiences intermittent connectivity in room.
		- Jefferson Ospina (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): I visited cheaper hotels in different cities before this one,  this hotel was a great stay, I regretted not staying at in this hotel longer with it's beautiful view and great service.   Breakfast is the best.   Don't sleep through it.   Price was about 65 usd.  The drinks and restaurant were rather pricey to local standards.
		- Hervé MATYSIAK (Herve-M) (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Vinpearl is a 5 star hotel, in Cần Thơ. The place is well located, entry easy for taxi/grab and near a big market place (Vincom). Deluxe room are really fine, bed confortable, AC running, fridge and other. Breakfast hasany option and not many in same time. From western style to asiatic one. Most of the time lacking of drink, glasses or cups. AC is barely settable or reset themself after a while. Elevator are little and do many stop during 'rush hour'. Provide a really good, reliable and fast service! Even some for 'honey moon' moment.
		- Kiet Huynh (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Great service, welcome drink. City view, price not high compare to the others 4,5 star hotel in the area. Morning buffet is included, various foods to serve including vietnamese food like " bun, pho, banh cuon" Its better if we can have more local western side food like " bun mam, banh xeo, bot loc". Located right beside Vincom shopping mall so you can easily to go shopping or cinema if you want. parking is free as well. However they are always asking for the room number or  questioning  like "where do you go", Even a staff asking to pay the money until i said the room number. Its not quite comfortable. Not sure is it a part of the process or simple judge by a look (bad motobike which rent at CanTho).
		- Penalto Miguel (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): I enjoyed my stay at this hotel, the staff are good and well educated, the restaurant and food all top 5, I was for 2 weeks for business.
		- Dan Vandenberg (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): The Vinpearl Hotel is an amazing location, a beacon of sorts, in Can Tho. As the tallest building around, complete with attached mall, the Vinpearl is a sight to see. There is a beautiful, Olympic-sized pool on the roof of the mall (6th floor) and a delicious, decadent buffet for breakfast. A must stay in Can Tho!
		- SY Khoo (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Grand hotel with great hospitality, the room is clean and comfortable to stay in, perfect with river view. Breakfast buffet has great selection of tasty food, the only thing is they don't have enough seats in the restaurant.
		- Peter Duong (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): The management should review the noise-proofing system. I heard noise from outside & from another room. Toilet water supplied pipes make a big noise while using.
		- Trip.com Member (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Hotel has changed from Vinpearl to Sheraton recently.One of the best Hotels in that area. Breakfast is great and amazing views from the rooms.Hotel is very responsive with email.
		- Trip.com Member (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Almost everything is good at this hotel.The one thing is the hotel rates are getting more expensive recently, especially if you book it too near the arrival date.
		- Mark Worsman (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): This was a pleasant surprise.  There were a few rough edges, but it was a genuinely nice hotel with good food and a decent breakfast, generous room sizes and the service was good too all things considered.would definitely return.

		- Nghi Nguyen (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Spacious space, comfortable seats. Diverse menu. Delicious drinks. A beautifully drawn cappuccino is okay!
		- Pham Huong (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): On December 23, my family and I went here with the intention of trying the afternoon tea set. I went to the staff and asked if they still had the afternoon tea set, but she said they no longer accepted bookings :(, what's going on? I just came as a customer who wanted to experience and pay, the staff didn't even ask if I was a tiktoker before saying that to the customer (even though I didn't intend to book anything... just wanted to pay for the afternoon tea to experience) and that made me a bit disappointed. In return, the croissant I ate that day was crispy, fragrant and delicious. I just hope Sheraton improves and is more active on FB because when I wanted to text to book a table, I didn't get a reply!
		- Navigator57937954174 (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): 4 years ago I stayed at Vinpearl, now I've come back to stay at Seraton Can Tho, there have been many changes and especially the reception service is very warm and thoughtful, Thoan has supported and helped my family a lot during the 2 days …
		- Emma (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Clean, beautiful and polite. View of the outdoor wedding party watching the sunset. Pool. Fast service. Food with western taste.
		- Mickael (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Having tested almost all the 5-star hotels in southern Vietnam, including the most prestigious in Ho Chi Minh City, the Sheraton remains one of my best experiences.  The hotel is spacious, as is its swimming pool with magnificent views. The room, of exceptional quality, combines comfort and elegance.  But the real surprise was the staff, both refined and attentive. Whether at the entrance, at reception, at breakfast or for room maintenance, each member of the team stands out for their professionalism.  We really feel considered thanks to the little everyday touches, which make all the difference.
		- Trip.com Member (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): This is the best hotel in Can Tho. The hotel price is cheaper than other cities and the breakfast is great. If you are going to tour the Cai Rang floating market in the early morning, it would be better to book a day without breakfast because you will eat rice noodles during the tour.
		- Tú Đỗ (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Super great experience Beautiful view, overlooking the whole Can Tho city Clean, big swimming pool, suitable for virtual life keke The gym has few machines, the personal mats are not cleaned so they are a bit dirty, but in return there is a smith machine keke The sauna is big, with dry sauna, wet sauna, jacuzzi Breakfast has delicious pho, matcha latte, delicious cake, not too sweet

		- Kate Nguyen (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): - Drinking water for guests left in the bathroom? - No shaving equipment. - The elevator does not have a sensor that automatically opens when someone enters. Easy to get stuck in the door.
		- Hiếu T (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): I feel the service at the hotel is extremely good. I hope to have the opportunity to return to the hotel in the near future. Sincere thanks to Suben, Vinh, Suong, Nhi, Tinh for supporting check in and check out. The rooms at the hotel are very nice, the staff are extremely friendly.
		- 규동이의 반백살 인생 (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Can Tho is 2 hours and 30 minutes from Ho Chi Minh by car! Among them, this is by far the most recommended hotel in Can Tho! This is Sheraton Can Tho.  This is a high-rise hotel in Can Tho, where you can reach anywhere including the dock, Can Tho Market, museums, and shopping centers within 10 minutes by car or 30 minutes on foot.  Even if I stay on the 22nd floor, the view is great, but the rooms on the 30th floor and above are fantastic. I highly recommend this place as it is a place to watch the sunrise and sunset in the morning and evening.  The hotel staff always greets and greets you kindly, creating a good image for the hotel, and the food is a harmonious combination of traditional food, Asian fusion, and fresh fruit to stimulate your taste buds.  Sheraton Can Tho Hotel is something you can immediately feel once you experience it first-hand.
		- Lãm N (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): The hotel has good facilities, easy to book, especially the enthusiastic consultant staff. The receptionist is friendly, Thoan guided the procedure quickly, and showed me many interesting places to visit. Next time I come to Can Tho, I will come back to support more. Thank you!
		- Nguyễn Đỗ Tường Vân (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): I introduced the room to many guests here, today I received an extremely bad attitude from the host named Tinh. My car was dropping off a tour guest because there were two cars parked in front, so I stopped to drop off the guest (the guest was staying at the hotel). There was one guest who had not gotten off yet, while I was waiting for her to get off, I told my friend that you wait a bit, and the other guest replied to me that if you move forward, your entire family will die (while the guest was walking down the door). I held back and I said that with your attitude, I called the manager. After that, the guest needed to send their belongings back to Saigon, I waited for the guest, and then the guest got off, I went into the lobby to talk to the guest. After talking to the guest, when I went out, my friend told the other two hosts that they threatened me to report it to the manager, I was probably scared. I don't believe that a 5-star hotel has such a bad host. 😔😔😔
		- Ralf (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Top-notch hotel. Even though we were a group of 30 people, check-in was extremely quick and easy.  The breakfast leaves nothing to be desired. From continental to Vietnamese and Indian – everything is there.  The rooms are well-equipped and very spacious.
		- Trip.com Member (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): It was nice to be able to stay at a luxury hotel at a low price. However, there were some shortcomings in terms of facilities and service. The room was cleaned after staying for several nights, but shower towels and other items were …
		- Kwangseok Park (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): It's noisy at night. Even when the air conditioner is turned off, there's still noise coming from the ceiling vent. I couldn't sleep all night 😴 The service is good. You can check in even if you come in the morning. The location is right next to Vincom Mall, so it's convenient for eating or using the children's play facilities. There's also a Vinmart on the basement floor. A restaurant on the 4th floor (two meals, meat buffet, sushi, etc.)
		- My linh Doan thi (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): The best hotel in Can Tho. From the service, reception, management and bar staff and pool staff. It's great. My wife and I are members of Sheraton and we had a very happy and enjoyable time here. The breakfast was delicious and tasty. The steak buffet was excellent. The meat was extremely tender. The next evening we will have a seafood buffet. I think it will be great. We will come back on Tet holiday with our son.
		- Công Minh T (N/A⭐, Không rõ ngày): Too very satisfied with all aspects of the hotel, the staff enthusiastically supported me when I needed to check out late, Suben supported me with late check out, compliments to Anna and Tinh, Thoan, you enthusiastically supported me to go upstairs and consulted hotel services, I will come back
