reviews:
		- Anh Huynh (1.0⭐, 2025-03-25): At 6:00 p.m. on March 22, I went into the store to buy things, and there was a lady who didn't know if she was the store's manager or something, but everyone called her Mom. I bought things and paid, everything would be normal. As soon as I turned away, the lady said "there's a bank that's scary to open for a long time" which was very annoying. Is it a problem if I buy something and it takes me so long to pay for it, when there aren't many customers or anything at that time?
		- Phước Thành Trần (5.0⭐, 2024-12-28): The store has a unique view, friendly and gentle staff, reasonable seating, and is a suitable place for students to rest and study.
		- Nhung Nguyễn (1.0⭐, 2024-12-28): 9:00 p.m. December 5, 2024 What's wrong with the staff here? When asked if I should take it to go or drink it here, I said ice separately - take it away. After making shared ice, I waited at the counter to pay for it so I could ice it together and didn't even bother calling it mine? Even if a bunch of customers yell at me, they won't be able to scream. Then, after heating up some cheese sausage or something, I can't remember the name, but after heating it, I put it under the barista's table - then I climbed in so I could get some. Then I put the Thai milk tea in the bag, and the ice part was told to be put in the bag of noodles and freshly heated sausage? So what do you do, father? Who dares to come back because he works as a service employee????
		- Lap Nguyen Thiet (5.0⭐, 2024-11-28): Enthusiastic, thoughtful, cheerful, sociable staff. The store sells quality items, reasonable prices, will come back again and again.

		- Ân Hoàng Thiên (1.0⭐, 2024-09-28): In the morning, I rushed to school and bought two rice balls, clearly telling you to warm them up for me and bring them to class. They were cold. When I stood there, I saw that the microwave had not changed gears so I reminded them.

		- Thảo Vy (1.0⭐, 2024-10-28): September 29, 2024, around 11 p.m., I was waiting at the checkout counter. There was a female employee who was charging for the friend who came first. I thought the employee would ask me what to order after finishing the bill, but when I didn't ask, I told her to give me a glass of Thai red size L. When I saw her answer, I asked her to order the same thing again. Then she turned around to answer and another customer came in to ask. After that, she asked me again what I ordered. I felt dissatisfied with the service attitude. and how b works.

		- Văn Lượng “XmaXa” Lê (1.0⭐, 2024-03-28): The staff has an attitude towards customers, does not confirm the order with the customer, the female staff member has the habit of speaking ill of the customer to others, calling him this or that.

		- Sim Lyhoe (1.0⭐, 2023-03-28): Worse experience , Cashier thought that I am vietnamese . I tried to speak to Chasier to buy viettel card for 20K , and she looked at me like I am beggar who beg her for some money . she is so rude .  just ignore me like no one speak to her .
		- PHOR Phann (5.0⭐, 2024-03-28): That’s a great time there. The staffs are so friendly and they speak English very well. And I found a handsome stock guy there. Mayb I have his Facebook or Instagram? Please!! 🙏🙏🙏🙏 …

		- Thoại Cao Kim (5.0⭐, 2024-12-28): Maybe drinking fresh milk coffee forever
		- Tuyet Thanh Le (1.0⭐, 2024-12-28): 1 star for the cashier right now (don't know what his name is) First, behave inappropriately with guests when there is a problem (loud voice, eye contact, arguing with guests) Second, solve the problem of dissatisfaction. I agree that I made a mistake. I wanted to call it green Thai lemon tea but mistakenly called it Thai green kumquat tea. But when I ordered, the cashier didn't ask, but when the water came out, I had questions and loudly "Correct" me. Third, I came here many, many times, and I ordered Thai red milk tea and ordered size SMALL, but the employee offered me only size 22 27 while my needs were only M??? But it's okay, the Manager needs to consider this employee, I'm doing a service job???
		- Truc Chung (1.0⭐, 2025-01-28): Staff are too disrespectful to customers. 3 or 4 people stood and talked, not charging customers. Order a cup of milk coffee, 1 bottle of unwrapped mineral water for guests as alms, etc
		- Thanh Hân Võ (5.0⭐, 2024-12-28): Convenience stores have many delicious dishes. Enthusiastic and cute consultant 🥰 …
		- Vi Kha Nguyen (3.0⭐, 2024-03-28): I often run design deadlines here, it smells a bit like food, guests coming here feel more comfortable => less noisy But I like the bustling style - Depending on the situation, sometimes it's ok and sometimes it's not understanding
		- Huong Bui (5.0⭐, 2024-12-28): The food is diverse and rich, an ideal place for friends to gather for a late night meal
		- Phương Phii (5.0⭐, 2024-12-28): The photos of the staff here are happy and cute

		- Chu Hiếu (4.0⭐, 2024-08-28): Good mini convenience supermarket, cheap items, staff don't seem as attentive as before, hope Circle K maintains the same quality as the first day
		- Dương Anh Khoa (5.0⭐, 2020-03-28): Pleasant staff, spacious and clean space. Diverse goods, no different from other Circle K branches.
		- nhung nguyen (1.0⭐, 2024-04-28): Attitude staff! Male employee, round figure, working the 12:00 noon shift on Monday, April 15, 2024, genuine attitude towards customers. Asking customers to come here to pay by waving their fingers?!? Asking for food is not as good as having a stubborn attitude like "Who makes you work? Life pushes you, but who wants to work?"
		- Trung Ruan (1.0⭐, 2020-03-28): Same system but the accompanying sauce is different! Inconvenient! Some have soy sauce, some don't! Asked the staff and was told there was no soy sauce!
		- Nhi (5.0⭐, 2024-12-28): Diverse goods, friendly staff
		- Poly Khô Gà (Càng Ăn Càng Mê Ly) (5.0⭐, 2025-03-24): Convenient, safe and fast

		- Huỳnh Phạm (1.0⭐, 2024-07-28): The staff's attitude is extremely bad. At 10:20 April 3, 2024, the blurry code took a long time to scan and the annoyed staff came out to me 🥲 …
		- Nguyen Tran (5.0⭐, 2024-11-28): Convenient, enthusiastic and cheerful staff
		- Nguyệt Nhiễm (5.0⭐, 2021-03-28): The employees are cute, the store is clean and airy, there are a lot of cute promotional items that you want to buy and use 😊 …
		- nhất giang (5.0⭐, 2024-12-28): Enthusiastic and lovely staff
		- Chu Nguyen The Hoang (5.0⭐, 2024-03-28): Airy space. There is air conditioning 24/7. Diverse products from fast food, instant noodles, drinks, snacks are very suitable for you to study, work or simply gather with friends. The convenience store is open 24/7, so it's inevitable that there will be times when it's crowded and messy, but the staff still tries to clean up as quickly as possible, so I rate it 5 stars. Sitting view overlooking Luu Huu Phuoc park and Ly Tu Trong street is very crowded and bustling.
		- Thông Nguyễn (5.0⭐, 2024-12-28): The staff are very good
		- Huỳnh Quang Minh (5.0⭐, 2024-12-28): Great service
		- Phương Tùng Phan (2.0⭐, 2021-03-28): I don't understand why the security guard stuffed my car in the middle. When I go out, I won't help you drive the car. But sit and look at yourself. When I left, I took another one and clamped it inside to tighten it.
		- Thành B10 Đạt (5.0⭐, 2024-11-28): The staff here are very thoughtful
		- KÊNH TIN HỌC NGUYỄN LỘC (5.0⭐, 2024-11-28): Good service, enthusiastic staff

		- Thanh Tâm (5.0⭐, 2024-12-28): Enthusiastic, cute and agile person
		- Huu Duy Tran (3.0⭐, 2024-03-28): Most of the customers came to run Deadline but the staff kept playing music to create tiktok. I think music is also a part that affects customers' psychology and experience!!!
		- Như Quỳnh (5.0⭐, 2024-11-28): Cheerful person, enthusiastic consultant.
		- Nghi Nguyen (4.0⭐, 2021-03-28): I like Circle K's fresh milk coffee the most, but it's a bit crowded and sometimes there's barely a place to sit.

		- Hưng Phạm Quốc (5.0⭐, 2024-12-28): The staff laments the beauty and flowers
		- Minh Tuyen (1.0⭐, 2023-03-28): I bought mixed noodles and saw that the staff member had a lot of customers, so I went to the table and waited. When the noodles arrived, he shouted loudly at me, "SEND ME MIXED NOODLES." Before he finished, he went over to the cashier and slammed the table. I don't understand what I did wrong. If I spent money to buy something like that, I would like to ask permission not to return to this store again. I looked at the name tag and saw the name Ly, so honestly, my attitude was oh my god
		- Hân Trương (1.0⭐, 2025-03-28): staff attitude
		- Đạt Đặng Thành (1.0⭐, 2024-06-28): The security guard speaks disrespectfully to customers and bullies them in the face
		- Mai Tran (2.0⭐, 2024-04-28): As soon as I entered the toilet, the staff arbitrarily cleaned up the customer's water
		- Thúy Liễu (5.0⭐, 2024-07-28): Clean, beautiful, airy, friendly and enthusiastic staff.
		- Phương Uyên (1.0⭐, 2024-03-28): I waited for a while because there was only one person folding glasses. When I called, he came to the cashier but his attitude was very rude. Even when he mixed the drink, he looked annoyed even though I spoke very politely to him, asking if I needed chili sauce or not. k, I said I need it, you show it to me, it's not called giving anymore. My friends saw everyone saying it.
		- Khuong Pham (3.0⭐, 2022-03-28): Mini supermarket operates overnight. But the price is better than other mini supermarkets
		- Lê Minh Thắng (1.0⭐, 2023-03-28): At 11:44 p.m. on October 21, I couldn't top up my momo (other places did), the staff talked without looking at the customer's face (named Anh was on the night shift many times), when I scanned the code, there was an error with the money being held for 15 days. Not receiving the money can take up to 30 days
		- Huỳnh Ngọc Thái 8a3 (5.0⭐, 2024-12-28): Friendly staff

		- Saing (5.0⭐, 2024-08-28): Airy space, enthusiastic staff
		- Như Thụy Trần (5.0⭐, 2024-03-28): In my opinion, this branch has a full range of products for sale and is rarely out of stock for instant foods. Nice place to sit overlooking the street.
		- Nguyen Doan Anh (1.0⭐, 2024-03-28): The service this morning, March 29, was so bad. Please do not change the store's service staff and the quality of the store will deteriorate.
		- Trần Ngọc Thành (5.0⭐, 2024-12-28): Good service, enthusiastic
		- AAU RADIO (5.0⭐, 2024-07-28): Good service, friendly staff.
		- lua ngo (1.0⭐, 2020-03-28): I go here a lot, but last night on December 29, there was a very annoying cashier who was a bit fat. I didn't pay attention to his name. When I came to pay, I arrived first but charged someone else first. When I saw that customer, why? When I was given a bag, I just asked and the employee replied to buy 4 bottles of water with an English name. The person repeated in an annoyed manner and laughed at me. The employee should have pointed out where the water was, not the water. They had never drank and laughed like that.
		- Thúy Quyên Lưu (1.0⭐, 2024-08-28): staff attitude is very bad
		- Minh Nhung Trương Thị (5.0⭐, 2024-11-28): Friendly and fun staff

		- Đạt Tiến trần (1.0⭐, 2021-03-28): I came to buy food, not to beg. I went late at 2:00 a.m. and found the staff's attitude very unpleasant, talking harshly and showing off to customers. I asked for a packet of chili sauce, then threw it away as if swearing I was a beggar. The response was curt. I went to any number of Circle Ks and was fine, except for Circle K Ly Tu Trong late at night.
		- tuan phan (5.0⭐, 2024-11-28): Good service
		- Thanh Bùi Hoàng Lan (5.0⭐, 2024-12-28): Friendly staff
		- Chi Cà Chua Pi (1.0⭐, 2021-03-28): CircleK's dignity requires staff's attitude to be unsuitable for a convenience store. Won't come back

		- Phan Nhã Văn (5.0⭐, 2024-12-28): Ok
		- Khoa Dunk (5.0⭐, 2024-07-28): nice
		- Anh Quí Lê (2.0⭐, 2025-03-28): The employee when I visited the store seemed annoyed. Feel disrespected by customers.
		- Thành Nguyễn (1.0⭐, 2024-07-28): Buy noodles mixed with eggs and beef sausage for 40k. The noodles are white and bland. When it comes to frying fried omelets, then fry them well, and use ketchup for chili sauce. If you sell it, you can get 40k
		- Thanh Tuấn Nguyễn (1.0⭐, 2025-03-28): I saw that the store had a program to give away 7-color rabbits because I liked the rabbit character and Mr. 5 so I bought it according to the program. Calculating the bill, it met the criteria, but the staff initially had an attitude and asked if I had accumulated points. I was not satisfied so I said I didn't need to accumulate (because I thought I would receive a gift according to the program, so no). After that, the staff did not say anything and let me calculate the bill. After calculating the bill, I wondered if I could not receive the rabbit. The staff said that if I don't accumulate membership points, I would not get a gift. Coming to Circle K because of the collab program with 7-color rabbits, I saw many big brands sponsoring it. Only the gifts are sponsored but I'm afraid customers won't be able to buy or sell anything else.
		- Bảo Thy (1.0⭐, 2024-09-28): NV despises KH extremely :)) Ask anything without hesitation When my co-worker asked, I said it was because I saw it "it's smaller" ??? go to work or be a grandfather? Avoid these types of people :)) I don't understand why I can still go to work haha🤣
		- Hoàng Phan Yến Nhi YD - K45 (3.0⭐, 2024-07-28): I don't understand why the network at this branch is weaker and more easily interrupted than other branches, so sometimes it's a bit inconvenient, not to be exact, sometimes like q**** and the power outlet here is very loose. It would be better if there was soap in the bathroom to wash hands and more frequent toilet paper The staff, depending on the shift, are sometimes super cute and sometimes look a bit rude Delicious water
		- Huy Tran (1.0⭐, 2025-03-28): 00:33:56 City staff advising on events do not ask customers to accumulate points or stamps before paying. Once they have paid, they say they must accumulate stamps before paying.
		- Ngan Lâm (1.0⭐, 2025-03-28): Came here for the rabbit, bought it for more money but walked out without any rabbit
		- Duyên Mỹ (1.0⭐, 2025-03-28): The staff is rude to customers, doesn't even greet or pay attention, asks them to wait a bit when they order, has an unpleasant attitude when customers order again.
		- S6 (1.0⭐, 2024-12-28): Not allowing guests to sleep at noon when tired even though they have bought food and water, along with the unpleasant attitude of the morning shift cashier on Wednesday, December 11, 2024
		- Heo Pham (1.0⭐, 2024-11-28): Usually I go in the evening, the night shift staff are very good, but today I went in the afternoon, the table was wet and I asked for a tissue to wipe but the staff was doing something and then closed the cabinet door with a loud bang. Extremely unpleasant attitude. Even though you're working as an employee, do you still want to be a mother?
		- Thuy Duong Huynh (1.0⭐, 2024-10-28): The staff has a disrespectful attitude toward customers. I will never return to this store again because I really don't like the staff's very bad service!!!
		- Quách Lê Trung Hiếu (1.0⭐, 2025-03-28): The staff's attitude is concave, they look down on customers, they won't come back a second time
		- Đặng Hiển (1.0⭐, 2024-03-28): Bought a large size cup of bamboo charcoal milk tea and added white pearls, the staff delivered a small sized cup and then called for the largest size there. The problem here is that there is absolutely no white pearls and still billed for money😀on the 3rd day of Tet, bad luck …
		- BÍCH CHI NHAN (5.0⭐, 2024-12-28): Cute and enthusiastic staff. Diverse goods and many attractive promotions
		- Tuyết T (1.0⭐, 2024-09-28): The employee's attitude is, after buying 3 bags of Kotex to get a bear gift, when I went out to buy it on September 1, the staff + manager said it was all gone. If you want it, you have to pre-order and pay 81k. If there's a bear, call to come get it and I'll pay a deposit in advance and I went out 3 times and said the bear hadn't come back yet. When I came out on September 13, I made an appointment for the morning of September 14 and told me the bear was gone. Because this batch only has 6 children. Instead of being naive from the beginning, don't say deposit. I went out 3 times to ask to avoid wasting time on things like that. I advise you not to deposit in advance like that. I was so angry that I took my money back, oh my god, I was really scared. The amount of money is not much but the attitude of the staff + management is very poor :))) Does anyone have a deposit or I can take it home? I'll wait for the rest of my life and I won't call.

		- ThienKim Nguyen (1.0⭐, 2024-07-28): Previously, he was a customer of CH, but the manager named him at 4/30, because of his disdainful attitude towards customers. Employers should review this person's work style. In my opinion, it's not up to standards, looks down on customers and co-workers, argues with customers, doesn't respect customers, and then flatters and talks to customers like normal. Very considerate, I really like circle K because of its convenience, but sadly when I met that guy named Tran again on CH 3/2 street, it's the place I choose to meet with friends and eat since I left CH over there.
		- Thị Như Quỳnh Nguyễn (1.0⭐, 2024-09-28): Add buffalo tapioca. When I bought it, I didn't have any buffalo tapioca. There are many cases of nv r
		- Quân Nguyễn (1.0⭐, 2024-07-28): The customers had to wait and the staff had to press their phones to scroll through tiktok. The two of them clicked at the same time, not one more time. The girl with the bright ponytail took a break and then went to sell to the customers, glancing at her like I was stealing from her. There was a time when there was a handsome and cute male friend selling it, but why has it changed to this damn girl?

		- Bảo Trân Hồ (1.0⭐, 2024-03-28): The staff has a bad attitude, 10 times the same, every staff member is bad, one day I ate leftover kimchi and asked for a bag to take home, looked at me with some eyes and then didn't care? There are days when I buy things at a premium, my attitude is uneven???
		- Sang Le (5.0⭐, 2024-11-28): Good service, the security guard is very cute
		- Zletko Freiberg (1.0⭐, 2024-03-28): The staff's attitude is like royalty, they just wait for the customer to remind them, then let them stand there and play :)) especially the fat black female staff named My who often calls on the phone, scans the code but is too lazy to let the customer do it themselves. Male employees with nose studs are very shy to work. If they can't do it, then they should quit. They're tarnishing Circle K's image. I think Circle K should train, monitor, and regularly purify its workforce to find the best. people who are better suited for the job.

		- Khanh Le quoc (5.0⭐, 2024-11-28): Good
		- Lê Anh Núi (5.0⭐, 2024-11-28): Good service
		- imre raudsepp (5.0⭐, 2023-03-28): Good prices and clean.
		- Nguyen Thao Ngan B2203348 (1.0⭐, 2025-03-14): The staff's attitude is unpleasant when customers can't park or charge money
		- Vu Tien Thanh (1.0⭐, 2025-03-14): The staff was uneducated, the female staff assigned to the shift at 10pm on March 9 had an attitude and words that did not respect customers.
		- Đăng Hải (5.0⭐, 2024-11-28): Enthusiastic staff, cool store, often has food sale programs
		- minhnguyet phamthi (1.0⭐, 2025-03-14): The staff has too much attitude. When I went in to buy goods, I asked if the worker was still on duty, not if the worker was off shift. So you're already on shift, no need to answer. If you have answered the question, even if the customer is startled, it will not affect you, so please answer with a sarcastic attitude. I spent money to buy it, but I don't ask for anything from you. Did you spend money to buy it and get that kind of attitude in return? As for the restroom, let me tell you whether or not you can use it. If I go in to buy, if I go up and my friend comes in later to buy, will it have any effect? I have to yell. I told you that you will come to the order later. You asked me back who my friend was, she was a strange woman with a very sharp way of talking to me. What is it?  Are you afraid you won't buy it or something?
		- Quang Truong Le (1.0⭐, 2025-03-28): The staff's attitude towards customers, providing wrong promotion information (I bought an item but did not notify in advance that the promotion was over but also put a mileage sign on the outside causing misunderstanding) leading to customers losing money unjustly.
		- Võ Châu (1.0⭐, 2025-01-28): Poor service staff attitude on January 6. Not good at talking to customers. Coffee is not the same as before. The taste is light, the coffee is no longer strong and boring
		- Cua đồng Võ (1.0⭐, 2024-11-28): The restaurant staff has a bit of an attitude towards customers. The male staff shifts at 7:53 p.m. on November 19, 2024. I spend money to eat, I don't beg, so I'm not very satisfied with this.
		- Thảo Như Nguyễn (1.0⭐, 2025-01-28): Thai Red is nothing, the mac smells like milk and no tea smell, it's so sweet, circle K doesn't have a formula, oh god Milk Coffee is more bitter than black coffee???
		- Bui Tri (1.0⭐, 2025-03-28): The toilet set cannot be used??? Is it necessary to shout like that?? If there is anything, can you say it softly? Look at your staff again!!!
		- Thư Nguyễn (1.0⭐, 2025-01-28): staff's attitude towards customers, providing false promotional information causing customers to unfairly lose money, making false payments, slow water service, incorrect billing
		- Diệu Hiền Đặng Ngọc (1.0⭐, 2024-11-28): Every day for promotion, buy 2 bottles of water, get 1 free, no need to accumulate points. Now I can't find the way to accumulate points to receive rewards. Bad vz
		- Phạm Nguyễn Tiểu Ngọc (1.0⭐, 2024-10-28): The attitude of the evening shift staff on October 17 was very, very bad. I request the store manager to reconsider, thank you.
		- Hanna (1.0⭐, 2024-10-28): The staff's attitude is so bad that it's unacceptable :))) There were 3 female customers and the store wasn't crowded, but I asked and didn't answer? If you don't support customers in checking out, you'll have a condescending attitude. Please don't. It's terribly frustrating :)) I'll never stop by again. I hope the store will fix it. I'm sure no customer will dare to visit like this.
		- tấn đĩ tấn đĩ bị hàn kín lỗ đít (1.0⭐, 2025-03-28): Staff's attitude towards customers, providing wrong promotional information without any correction
		- Thùy Thanh (1.0⭐, 2024-12-28): The staff had a grumpy face and talked rudely, spending money to buy things and doing as I asked
		- Huy Trần (4.0⭐, 2020-03-28): Circle K Ninh Kieu wharf - It's been a long time since I went to Ninh Kieu wharf. While I was going there, I saw a new convenience store and saw a lot of people buying it. You should stop by for a walk around. - The store is located on Hai Ba Trung street, night market, food area. In a row, this store is the brightest and most prominent so it is very easy to find. - The store has quite a large staff, always cheerful and enthusiastic, and the service is also attentive. - The shop's space is quite small, only enough for about 5 people to shop, but it's packed, but there are enough products like other supermarkets. Especially food and beverages are complete. In addition, they also sell fast food including dumplings, egg noodles... they also serve drinks like coffee, something in English that I don't remember but I call it shaved ice :)) - In addition, there is an area above where guests can bring food and drinks to enjoy. Upstairs, the space is more open, more comfortable, there are plenty of tables and chairs and the distance is just enough to be able to talk privately without affecting those around you. In my opinion, here you can sit and study quite reasonably and never fear hunger. There are chairs in front of the hallway to sit on, but it's quite hot here because the cars passing by make it very hot. There are days when there are a lot of moths gathering here, so I don't like sitting out here.
		- 2317_Nguyễn Thị Bích Ngân (1.0⭐, 2024-10-28): At 10:30 p.m. October 17, 2024, I entered the store and there were 3 female employees with rude attitudes and no respect for customers. Too bad.
		- Vy Vu Ha (1.0⭐, 2025-03-28): The staff had a very bad attitude at 11:00 p.m. on February 14, 2025
		- is jasmine (5.0⭐, 2020-03-28): The shop is also easy to find, the staff is cute and BEAUTIFUL 🥺 I bought 3 rice balls today, but I was still bewildered by the staff member asking if I wanted to reheat them. It was my first time going to circle K so I didn't know where to get Froster and the staff showed me where to go. Upstairs is also comfortable and cool, with seating on the balcony. The food is also good, the rice balls "Shrimp with Mayo sauce" are very delicious 🥳
		- Linh Quỳnh Phương (5.0⭐, 2024-10-28): Dedicated and attentive staff, delicious food and drinks, fast and neat

		- Quan Phúc (Review) (4.0⭐, 2024-12-28): 📷 About transportation: located on Ninh Kieu walking street. 📷 About space: not too large. 📷 About service: okay. ⚖️ General assessment: Staff should pay attention to what customers choose.

		- Cẩm Hường (1.0⭐, 2022-03-28): At about 8:40 p.m. on May 27, 2021, I went to Circle K 128 Hai Ba Trung to buy goods and was treated with the attitude of this store's staff. For Circle K 10,000 or 20,000, there is no need, but the staff showed an attitude of not wanting to serve. Now the service attitude of Circle K staff is like that. Last time I went to store 118 3/2 Street, the staff had the same attitude.
		- Không Khó Làm Giàu (5.0⭐, 2022-03-28): While many people are sleeping soundly, the supermarket staff are still awake to serve customers with shopping needs. At midnight, you just took a walk along the riverbank to look at the stars and stopped for a cup of hot noodles, then you ran out of ideas. That said, this supermarket doesn't only sell noodles, but also all kinds of food. Because it's a supermarket! Wishing all our employees good health and wishing the supermarket to grow and expand everywhere!!!

		- Anh Thư Nguyễn Phan (1.0⭐, 2025-03-28): At about 10:45 a.m. on February 2, 2025, I stopped by CircleK nvc to buy things. The FEMALE EMPLOYEE who charged was very rude. The customer said that you charged her for an hour but still tried to complete her work. When I charged again, you didn't ask if you had points or not, but pressed the bill quickly. You didn't even give me the bill. When you finished making the coffee, you gave it to the customer as if someone had eaten all of your money. Oh, I bought it and paid for it properly, I won't waste any of your time. If you feel in a bad mood, don't go to work and take that attitude out on others
		- Lam Trần (1.0⭐, 2025-03-07): At noon on March 3, I stopped by Circle K to buy things, but the employee had a bad attitude, was unfriendly and unprofessional while I was a customer and spoke to him very politely. Hope the store improves its service to bring a better experience to customers.
		- Phát Mai (5.0⭐, 2024-12-28): At 8:00 a.m. on December 9, I stopped by to buy Indomie mixed noodles and sausages. I also ordered green Thai cf fresh milk. The consultant advised me that the drink is very stable, so stop by this store to experience it, everyone.
		- Mây Mây (1.0⭐, 2025-03-28): Truong An staff working the night shift had an attitude and glanced at customers, asking questions without answering. I sent a box of food to reheat. When I paid to leave, they didn't put it in for me. When I came back to ask, they didn't answer. When I charged, they didn't ask if I had accumulated points? I buy things and pay for them, I don't beg anyone. Next time I come to buy and have such a rude attitude, I will curse directly and record a clip, don't say why I'm rude!!!!
		- Duyên Đoàn (5.0⭐, 2024-12-28): Delicious Thai green lemon tea, lovely staff. I hope there are many promotions, shop.
		- Vy Tường (1.0⭐, 2024-12-28): The staff had an unpleasant attitude and at about 2 o'clock they did not allow customers to sit in the restaurant when it was raining
		- Mi Nguyen Ngoc (1.0⭐, 2024-10-28): I went at 12 o'clock and the staff didn't allow me to sit at the restaurant and forced customers to sit on the steps in front of the store. I'll never come back here😤 …
		- Long Hoàng (1.0⭐, 2024-09-28): I'm a shipper who stopped by to top up money, but after visiting a few times, the staff's condescending attitude was obvious. Also refused to top up due to system error. Meanwhile, when I went to the nearest branches, the staff was very enthusiastic and didn't make any mistakes at all.
		- Phát Lê Tấn (5.0⭐, 2024-11-28): Happy staff. I like Le Nguyen, he is very happy and enthusiastic, he always feeds me
		- Chem Ya (1.0⭐, 2024-09-28): I swear, there is an employee in the office who is extremely uncomfortable =)) and there is no discrimination, but I work as a service person and am open. When customers buy things, they always get stared at, and when I enter the bathroom, I can't stand it.
		- Hoàng Duy Nguyễn (1.0⭐, 2024-09-28): Last night at 8:50 p.m., I went to Circle to use the service, but when I walked in, the staff's attitude was not serious, too noisy when there were customers. When I consulted ctrinh and I asked how ctrinh was, but the attitude was very superficial, not even answering my question. The last problem was that I bought milk tea at the counter, the staff informed me that the type I needed was out of stock, so I temporarily bought a cup of original oolong milk tea. But the result the staff brought out was that the milk tea was poured into a glass from the available bottled milk tea and they arbitrarily added an ice remover for me (is this what I need?). What I want to reflect here is that the staff's way of answering and asking questions is not clear, and they joke around when customers first enter until they leave. This needs to be reminded. Next time I will not use the service at this branch again, thank you for the service.

		- Trang Khánh (1.0⭐, 2024-03-28): At 6:36 a.m., my friend and I went to Circke K. While going upstairs, I swiped a cup of noodles on the shelf. Before I could react, a male employee in front of the counter shouted, "Oh my God." , this guy shouted loudly and then looked at us intently, if the manager doesn't believe me, can you check the camera again, I picked up the noodles and arranged them neatly, the male employee was still staring at us upstairs, I hope the manager can review it And remind her about the attitude of an employee ❤️

Family members or patients visiting the clinic can also easily buy basic necessities, or at least eat and drink quickly, at reasonable prices, without worrying about price gouging. Cirle K here has a small space so the goods are just right, not very diverse. Cute and enthusiastic staff. The quality of food and drinks is still guaranteed compared to other stores. There are also a few seats in the store where customers can sit.
		- Nhuy Vo (2.0⭐, 2024-03-28): I've been there many times and this time my experience was really bad. The staff's attitude was bad, from payment to work. The staff was missing my food, so the food wasn't worth the money, but the staff still threw the food. Mine was mushroom rice and was thrown into the oven like a toy :))) The service attitude was also not good. After charging, the bill was not given to the customer :)))

		- Hiep Nguyen (5.0⭐, 2024-11-28): Vip
		- Cherry Lee (2.0⭐, 2024-03-28): Coffee is famous for its deliciousness, it's true, but the coffee is a bit too hot so it smells a bit burnt. Freshly mixed is the best. The straw and the place where the straw is inserted are too small, so mixing the coffee is a bit difficult. Sitting and admiring the scenery is quite chill, but the price is quite expensive. When I went in the morning, the staff was friendly and quick even though there was only one person at the counter and one assistant. The table was full of trash, but the place where I was sitting was left with the same trash as the previous guest. When guests bring smelly dishes, they sit next to them and enjoy them all.
		- Agustine (4.0⭐, 2025-03-28): The quality is okay, the seating area is a bit dirty from time to time, the staff is very cute, I hope circle doesn't add more US or UK songs because there are some songs that are boring to listen to :v
		- Quang Lê (1.0⭐, 2024-10-28): I know that working in the service industry has many difficulties and there are still sunny days and hours (specifically, it was 10am when I bought it), but I felt a bit of a problem with the behavior of a female employee on duty on the morning of Sunday, October 27. I just felt a little uncomfortable, so I just wanted to give my opinion. As for the food, you have to reheat it twice to get it warm????😞 I don't know if it's due to a problem with the microwave or if the staff reheated it too quickly, not just once.
		- Nam (1.0⭐, 2024-12-28): At night, when paying, I saw the staff holding the product, looking at the expiration date, then putting it in my bag. I trusted it so I didn't look at it again. When I took it out to eat, I found out that the product had expired. It was expired and still sold.
		- Đức Kỳ (5.0⭐, 2024-11-28): The staff is very enthusiastic, his name is Cuong, he is very friendly with customers, so the manager should consider increasing his salary.
		- Ngọc Hải (1.0⭐, 2025-01-28): Security guard on January 11, 2025 had a very bad attitude, glanced at customers, played on the phone during working hours, very uncomfortable
		- Yuan Yuan (1.0⭐, 2025-01-28): Guests who come first pay for those who come later. I told my friend that I'd come first, but you still ignored me. It's too crowded so you don't need customers.
		- Axl (1.0⭐, 2024-11-28): The facilities are quite bad -The trash piled up in two bins and no one emptied it -Every dining table is full of trash - 2 air conditioners, one very cold and one very hot - Ants crawling on the table and no one takes care of them The rest of the food is ok
		- SƯƠNG- Bà Rịa TUYẾT (5.0⭐, 2024-11-28): Great experience using the service I came to CT for a tourist trip so I used it quickly Will support if come back
		- Khoa Trần (1.0⭐, 2024-11-28): If you give the wrong item to a customer, if the item is wrapped in a package, leave it to another customer to take it out, it's best not to come
		- Nam Huỳnh Trung (1.0⭐, 2025-01-28): Security guard on January 11, 2025 sat playing on the phone, had a very unpleasant attitude towards customers, and glanced at customers very unpleasantly.
		- Nguyen Tri Tai B2102257 (5.0⭐, 2024-11-28): The employee I met the other day was very nice. She supported me enthusiastically
		- Dung Ha (5.0⭐, 2024-11-28): Staff Cuong is cute and friendly, enthusiastic and gives good advice, love photos 🤭 …
		- Vi Kha Nguyen (2.0⭐, 2024-03-28): One of the dirtiest places in CT I've ever been to I go quite a lot in CT so for me this is the place where people lack the most awareness. The fault is not with the nv. It's near high school and near the boulevard. + add this OK upstairs, nv doesn't clean it often + add lack of customer awareness. Even though it was written to put them in the bin, I saw many people who were illiterate. I remember Vietnam had already eliminated illiteracy. (almost)
		- Koro (5.0⭐, 2024-12-28): The store is both genuine and deep

		- Nguyễn Tấn Tài (1.0⭐, 2024-04-28): Staff does not arrange products properly. Intentionally wrongly arranged to cheat customers on prices. When I found out and changed my mind about buying it, they said bad things and glared at me
		- Nguyễn Quốc Thái (1.0⭐, 2024-08-28): Selling expired and rancid products, I bought 2 rice balls and when I opened them to eat, both balls were sour
		- Yuri (1.0⭐, 2023-03-28): When I came to buy 1 cup of bread, there was no one in line as the first buyer. While paying, 2-3 customers came to pay one after another and left. While I finished paying, I still had to wait for the next customers to pay before I could make coffee and bread. When I asked why that was so, the employee replied that it was because of the food I bought that I had to wait until she charged the other customers before she could do it. I asked if there was any way for me to comment on this issue, but she said she didn't know anything. His name is Le Minh Tuan

		- Trần Vy - 8A4 (1.0⭐, 2023-03-28): ncct shop, staff attitude, without giving money but already demanding like the famine in Backy 1945, asking for no but as if wanting to eat all my family's ancestors, male staff is better at charging than women, one time I called the staff and called 1-2 but didn't answer so I had to call by my name to answer, calling uncle also couldn't work, selling less and ncct, but it's the only place I can buy. tphngvy
		- Viluu Võ (1.0⭐, 2023-03-28): Waiting for a while, the staff saw clearly but still charged the person who came later and forced me to bring the items over while I left the items at the open counter. The employee's name is Hung, how is he trained without knowing the queuing culture? So disappointing

reviews:
		- ktyn (2.0⭐, 2025-03-14): This morning I bought 1 rice ball. Thanks to the staff to heat it up for me, I waited twice as long as usual even though I was the only one who bought it. The rice was cold, even though it was only 3 minutes before I went to class at the store =))
		- Nguyệt Minh Khúc (5.0⭐, 2024-03-28): The store is located on the front of 3/2 street, at the corner near the intersection, quite easy to find. Homogeneous items compared to chains. The staff members, the two times I came, spoke softly, asking carefully about the food I chose such as whether the coffee was sweet or bitter, whether the bread had vegetables or chili, etc. Inviting me to go upstairs and wait because I was afraid that standing for too long would make my legs tired. Some store promotions are updated to introduce to customers and post signs at the counter. Very clear. The sitting space is clean, there are air-conditioned rooms and outdoor rooms.
		- Thơ Hoàng (5.0⭐, 2024-09-28): The employee tonight (September 17) was super nice
		- Huynh Hieu Travel (4.0⭐, 2024-03-28): The space is quite good, the upper floor has a row of tables inside the air-conditioned room and sockets.  Especially one of the few Circle K in Can Tho with a rooftop terrace facing the outside.
		- Thí Zii (1.0⭐, 2025-03-22): Employees show attitude and speak harshly to customers when consulting.

		- nguyễn thanh sang (5.0⭐, 2024-11-28): Gooddd
		- Nguyễn Nguyễn (5.0⭐, 2025-01-28): nice staff
		- Bo Hoàng (5.0⭐, 2024-11-28): Cf ngonnnnn
		- Lĩnh Nguyễn Trọng (Lĩnh Lĩnh) (4.0⭐, 2024-08-28): The staff is enthusiastic and cute, but usually when I come to this circle k, I see very few dumplings and spring rolls, only noodles, and there's no place to sit down and type on the computer, so I'll deduct one star from this place. The rest is ok Besides the spring rolls and dumplings, the other foods are as diverse as other k circles, so there's nothing to say. The toilet is clean and fragrant. In general, the toilet here is quite okela Having a table outside at night is also a plus point, I quite like it
		- Mỹ khánh (1.0⭐, 2025-03-28): I went to buy water, but because the bank had an error, I couldn't log in and didn't have enough cash, so I told the staff not to buy anymore. I spoke very politely and clearly, but the staff immediately responded with a very frustrated attitude, putting the items away forcefully as if they were tormenting me. Well, I don't have an attitude towards you, you have an attitude towards me
		- Huynh Hieu Travel (2.0⭐, 2024-03-28): Circle K brand, however the restaurant is quite empty, so many items are not complete. The restaurant is quite small so the seating is not too spacious. And there is only 1 employee so sometimes work will be slow.  However, the view is quite beautiful in the morning with lake view and bougainvillea flowers
		- Gia Khánh Huynh Ngọc (5.0⭐, 2024-11-28): Enthusiastic and friendly staff, many attractive promotions
		- Oanh Huỳnh thị thuý (5.0⭐, 2024-11-28): Cute and enthusiastic staff. Small area but chil chil view
		- Thành An (ShopeeFood) (4.0⭐, 2024-08-28): Don't know what to rate, the restaurant is on a convenient street, with outdoor tables.
		- Như bình Lâm (5.0⭐, 2024-12-28): I have become a regular customer of this store. The staff here are always welcoming and ready to assist customers. I was especially impressed with the quick and convenient service. The store always ensures product quality and reasonable prices. Well worth a visit 🥳🥳🥳 …
		- Cuong Nguyen Quoc (1.0⭐, 2024-11-28): The story is that around 3:00 a.m. on November 24, I went in to buy food and was about to go to the bathroom. I saw on the door "0:00 a.m. - 6:00 a.m., please contact the staff".. there were 2 workers, I asked but they Answered quite hesitantly and with an attitude of not wanting to let me use it but not saying it directly. If you really can't use it, just say you're happy, but you give a lot of reasons like insect spraying, cleaning, etc. This is truly the worst experience at Circle K ever for me. .
		- Thúy Liễu (5.0⭐, 2024-07-28): It's great, you can even get a free breakfast cake if you drink a cup of milk. Nv is so cute 😁 …
		- Nguyen Thi Anh Hau B2101143 (5.0⭐, 2024-11-28): Staff Van Toan, cheerful, enthusiastic and cute, makes very delicious low-sweet milk coffee

		- Đan Trương (5.0⭐, 2024-12-28): View of the store is beautiful and chill. The service staff is quite friendly.
		- Lương Nguyễn Nhật Cường (5.0⭐, 2024-11-28): Dan Ton's photo is so bad. You caught me so hard. I'm forced😭😭 …

		- Đạt Trần (2.0⭐, 2024-06-28): The store's location is chill but the staff's attitude is 3/10 points
		- Đạt Lâm (5.0⭐, 2024-12-28): Great ! Convenient location for shopping
		- Tú như (1.0⭐, 2024-05-28): Staff attitude, when I went in the evening, 2 girls were also big and looked at their faces like I ate all of their food. Overall, it was bad.
		- phv (1.0⭐, 2024-05-28): The toilet was broken for more than a month without being repaired. I didn't know where to go so I had to leave early. Staff promises too much. I see the staff can go, but they don't let customers go.
		- Tiên Lê Thị Kiều (2.0⭐, 2024-04-28): Just bought a colgate mint toothpaste. The cashier didn't take the package for me. I was waiting and he saw that and asked if I could get the package? I responded that if you get a wrap, you should get a tiny wrapper that won't fit the product. Please ask for a larger wrap, you said we are saving on wrapping??? If you sell an item without a wrapper, what will the customer bring home? You already took a small wrapper for the customer, so why don't you get a large one that fits the product you sell? Lack of enthusiasm and thoughtfulness
		- Nhật Hào Nguyễn (5.0⭐, 2024-12-28): Convenient, lovely staff
		- trihh thak (5.0⭐, 2024-11-28): great nv I was forced by Mr. Hoai
		- Lê Thị Ngọc Hoa 10-10-00 (1.0⭐, 2024-03-28): The staff lacks enthusiasm, the branches of Ly Tu Tuong, Nguyen Viet Hong, 3/2 Diagon Alley 51 are also ok, coming to this branch twice is the same, probably there is no need to sell or anything.
		- Thịnh Mập (1.0⭐, 2024-03-28): Staff member Chu Ngoc Hanh calculates the bill at 22:59:31 August 6 for a promotion program for customers. Choose when the customer is checking out and ask the customer if they can get a promotion. Because the customer doesn't listen, you don't attach the promotion!!

reviews:
		- Quang Trần (5.0⭐, 2024-11-28): Good
		- Quế Anh Nguyễn (5.0⭐, 2024-07-28): Okla
		- Huy Minh (1.0⭐, 2025-03-07): 2:50 March 1, 2025 I had a bad experience at this branch, the staff showed contempt, could not understand how they could go to work with an attitude of making trouble with customers, I advise you to go to another branch to have a better experience at this place that is considered a verbal hell.
		- Quang Minh (1.0⭐, 2025-03-28): The employee on shift 16:00 February 26, 2025 spoke very harshly and unpleasantly to customers, customers came to buy things and he acted like he was a beggar guest of his house v? For example, when it comes to the word "yes" and he doesn't even say anything, how can he do it? (Male employee)
		- tâm Đoan (1.0⭐, 2025-01-28): I heard a lot about it so I tried it but I didn't expect it to be as rumored. I felt that the staff was very polite towards customers, especially the guy with the black hat and his face was so grumpy. The prices were sky-high and the service was so poor, so disappointing.
		- Duc Nguyen Minh (1.0⭐, 2024-11-28): Fraudulent sales Last night I bought dumplings at Circle K at this branch. The normal price of quail egg meat dumplings is 20k but the employee sold it to me for 25k and said it was mixed with salted eggs but gave me normal meat and egg dumplings without salted eggs. Furthermore, when selling, your attitude was very rude and superficial when I asked about the price of the cake
		- Hứa Diệp (5.0⭐, 2025-03-28): They are cute, super enthusiastic, have traveled to many places and this place is the most fun
		- Trần Huỳnh Nhiên (2.0⭐, 2024-10-28): If a customer buys a bottle of water, it's a purchase, but here it says you can transfer money for 12k hmm, what is that, male employee?
		- Nhi Châu (3.0⭐, 2024-11-28): Upstairs, there are some places that are quite dirty and have a lot of ants. The security guard has an inappropriate attitude towards guests
		- Bùi Lê Tấn Phát (5.0⭐, 2024-12-28): Maybe you're too picky, but I find the staff very friendly and cheerful
		- Biện Tuyết Mai (1.0⭐, 2024-09-28): Opened the program, 3 packs of Kotex were given as gifts but 8 stores didn't have any left, the staff responded harshly to customers... At 11pm, I wanted to sell out all the Circle K branches in Can Tho and there was nowhere to go. They also gave away bears, where there were bears, there were no bandages, where there were bandages, there were no bears, the staff were so cheerful that they responded to customers as if they were just asking for help, the staff were so bad...

		- Nhật Hoàng (1.0⭐, 2024-08-28): The female employee was not enthusiastic about buying the 15k can of energy drink. The cold can asked if there were 2 cans left that weren't cold. Buy 2 get 1 free. The female employee answered no. When she charged, the male employee asked if he wanted to buy a larger one. Can't he get 1 can? The female employee didn't want to say anything. I said the cold can take 2 cans because if I don't drink it all the time, I'm afraid it'll spoil. The male employee rushed back and got 2 cold cans. That's how the male employee had the heart. , NV sells products but doesn't want to sell a lot of products
		- Sang Tran (1.0⭐, 2025-03-28): Staff do not respect customers

		- Huy Trân Thanh (1.0⭐, 2024-03-28): On October 23rd, I stopped by at 10am and there was a chubby employee who worked very passionately. He closed the door as if to intimidate the customer. Disgusting.

		- Duy Linh Nguyễn (5.0⭐, 2024-07-28): Circle k is opposite gate B to hunt for gifts
		- Nguyễn Hoàng Nhật Hào (4.0⭐, 2024-03-28): It's an ideal place to meet deadlines because the space upstairs is comfortable and the view is quite good. However, some people are not very conscious so they are a bit loud. As for the unprofessional staff attitude, I haven't encountered it yet because it was just my first visit. Temporarily give 4 stars.
		- Tiên Đoàn (1.0⭐, 2024-03-28): Today I went to the store at around 12:00 noon on September 12, 2023. There was a female employee wearing glasses and a cash register attitude with no respect for the customer. She glanced here and there, very disrespectful to the customer, and the security guard did not. If you are happy to lead the car, you will not lead the car for the customer
		- Lý Song Huy (1.0⭐, 2024-03-28): The staff has a bad attitude towards customers, doesn't dress properly, if the CIRCLE K system doesn't resolve it completely, I will make a clip about the store's experience to post on fb and tiktok.
		- Duyên Mỹ (5.0⭐, 2024-07-28): nvien is very helpful, enthusiastic advice (if you guys say nvien deposit, what do you do, I will deposit again :) )
		- Link Ngu (1.0⭐, 2024-12-28): Staff attitude is very strange
		- Trâm Huỳnh (1.0⭐, 2024-03-28): Management should review the service of the staff, the service attitude is very poor, really unprofessional. I also used to work in service, so I looked at the staff from the most sympathetic perspective, but the staff did not respect me (namely, a small, black-haired, thin female and a slightly tall female with slightly blonde hair). between people but still have such an uncivilized attitude. However, the other people were very professional, especially the case of a slightly plump girl with black hair. The person who took care of customers was very nice.
		- Nhật Tân Vlog (5.0⭐, 2024-07-28): Enthusiastic staff. Service is ok. Give 5 stars
		- Truân Đặng (5.0⭐, 2024-07-28): Management staff OK, enthusiastic and thoughtful. Worthy of 5 stars
		- Thành Văn (1.0⭐, 2024-03-28): Today I visited the store. When paying and purchasing additional goods, Binh's attitude was very unpleasant
		- Lại Thảo (1.0⭐, 2024-03-28): October 13, 2023 at 10:40 p.m. I'm sitting here and have to evaluate immediately. I came to buy food but I thought I was a beggar. I'm a weight collector, not a president, but my attitude is z Great-grandmother, the five people are very friendly but each cashier has a very condescending attitude. IT'S BORING.
		- Tien Tran (5.0⭐, 2024-07-28): The staff is very enthusiastic, especially LAM QUI CHAU
		- Nguyen Long (5.0⭐, 2024-03-28): The female employee wearing glasses is very cute, enthusiastic service, spacious store, so stop by to support
		- Thâu Đêm (1.0⭐, 2024-03-28): Employees Work Like Guests' Great-Grandparents.... Service Not Guaranteed High Price But Poor Service
		- Tám Võ (5.0⭐, 2025-03-28): Good service and happy people
		- Nghi Thảo (1.0⭐, 2023-03-28): At 9:45 p.m. on August 10, 2022, I went to Circle K, 3/2 Street, Can Tho University. At that time, I didn't bring money or a bank card. I asked if I could transfer money. The female employee raised her voice and said yes. I can pay, there is a QR code for VN pay, but I don't have VN pay so I can't pay. I asked again if I had a bank account, but the female friend had a very harsh attitude and raised her voice to me. Satisfied After giving me my bank account, a male employee next to me stopped me, and explained to me that I can only pay via VN pay, I can't transfer money to my bank account, so it's ok. But here, I think the female service is unprofessional and the attitude towards customers is unprofessional. Before, I've heard many people rate the staff here's attitude towards customers, so I don't visit much. Visiting once is really scary🥹
		- thư trần (5.0⭐, 2024-07-28): The staff enthusiastically advises customers, and the person wearing the clip gives advice very enthusiastically
		- Thúy Lê (5.0⭐, 2025-03-23): Friendly staff
		- Bel Nguyễn (1.0⭐, 2023-03-28): I personally came to experience the service, paid more than the outside premises to experience the service, but the service staff was poor, very unenthusiastic, and had an attitude of looking down on others, so I should reconsider. I've come here many times. I used the service but was treated unpleasantly, so I don't like it.
		- Thanh Trúc Phạm Nguyễn (1.0⭐, 2024-03-28): Very poor attitude and service quality, empty conversation with customers
		- Trí Minh (1.0⭐, 2025-03-07): The fat guy has an attitude
		- Võ Thu Ngân (5.0⭐, 2023-03-28): I used to be a waiter and I understand very well when there are many customers, so there are a few mistakes, but they are not to blame. In addition, you are very enthusiastic about finding products for me and also introducing many promotions for me.
		- Thiện Minh Nguyễn (1.0⭐, 2024-03-28): Staff attitude is very bad, cultural level is very poor, management needs to review personnel.

		- Hân Hồ (5.0⭐, 2024-07-28): Enthusiastic and friendly staff ☺️☺️

		- Minh Anh Nguyễn (1.0⭐, 2025-03-28): The male employee on the evening shift on March 27 (around 11pm) knew that the bill had been paid but he talked very sweetly, meaning this isn't the first time you find it cute doesn't mean others find it pleasant, the manager should reconsider this guy because it's been many times, not just once :))))), how can a convenience store have a cashier standing there talking sweetly and not letting the customer leave :))))

		- EVNSPC (4.0⭐, 2024-03-28): normal

Overall, I haven't had any problems with this store, I just need to be more welcoming.  Most of you always make the drinks exactly as requested. My wife doesn't drink sweets so she always buys them with little sugar or no sugar.  (Coffee cup images are from the store, fruit and yogurt are not included)
		- Huệ huệ (1.0⭐, 2025-03-23): Bought boiled eggs for breakfast but the raw eggs oozed, so why eat them????
		- phượng oanh nguyễn thị (1.0⭐, 2025-03-28): On February 1, around 6:00 a.m., I went to circle K and sat for about an hour or so. The security guard outside kept the car for me, but the Jollibee security guard took my car twice to the street and the security guard just sat and watched.
		- Trường Ngô (1.0⭐, 2025-01-28): At 2-3 a.m. on January 25, 2024, I went in to buy something and there was a female employee. At that time, I went to look for a toilet and asked her and she answered me with a question that made me freeze for 5 seconds. For a second, "HEY HEY", I thought I was your child.
		- Lộc Ngân (1.0⭐, 2025-03-28): I arrived at CK at 7:00 p.m. on February 2, and the security guard was angry and annoyed when he took the car for me.
		- My Tu (1.0⭐, 2025-03-28): Security guard on Sunday shift at 7:30 p.m. bullies guests. I thought I was a beggar going to circle K so I raised my voice so loudly
		- Huynh Hieu Travel (4.0⭐, 2024-03-28): Circle K is quite crowded here, located near the school so many students often visit. Sometimes you will have to wait quite a long time if it's time to start or end class. The space is relatively okay, the upper floor has sockets and is relatively okay.
		- Võ Nguyễn Huyền Trân (1.0⭐, 2024-10-28): Cashier Thi Thanh Thao, when I went in to buy groceries at 10 p.m., her attitude was very unfriendly and disrespectful to customers.
		- My Xuan (1.0⭐, 2024-11-28): The service staff is bad, uncomfortable, talks to customers and treats them like thieves 😑 …
		- Gia Han Nguyen (1.0⭐, 2024-09-28): Staff on 12h shift on September 12, 2024 had a bad attitude. When I went to order water, the male employee standing at the mixing counter heard and started preparing the water. However, the female employee standing at the cashier counter made no move, still attentively checking the goods list, not even looking up at the customer even though he was standing right in front. When I asked "Is anyone here ordering?", I quickly said yes, looked at the customer and placed the order on the machine.  This is the first time I've encountered a case of staff having such a weak attitude and looking down on customers. Too bad.
		- Phúc Nguyễn Trần Minh (1.0⭐, 2024-09-28): The employee named Thuy Vy has a disdain for customers. It was estimated that there was a shortage of goods, so I happily came back to give more. I said take the difference so I can go home, you can fix something to match, then slowly do it. As for him, he turned around with a disdainful attitude and said he had to wait until he erased his monosexuality from the beginning. He's probably a descendant of the system owner, so many customers gave him 1* reviews because he hasn't been kicked out yet
		- Phúc Thịnh (5.0⭐, 2024-12-28): Pleasant staff with security guards to keep the car, spacious and clean seats
		- Đăng Hồ (1.0⭐, 2025-01-28): The female employee had a bad attitude and a very rude face
		- Anh Như (5.0⭐, 2024-12-28): Cute staff, neat merchandise, clean store
		- Phương Vy Phạm (5.0⭐, 2025-01-28): Ms. Ai Nhu is very cheerful, dedicated, cheerful and sociable ❤
		- Thanh Hoàng (4.0⭐, 2024-03-28): The store is clean and airy, the products sold here are good, but some of the staff still don't respect customers. Hope to fix it
		- minh anh kieu nguyen (1.0⭐, 2024-08-28): The staff's attitude doesn't care about anything, it's not good at all. When the guests come, the yard is silent. If they want to be picked up, if they don't like it, the attitude is like a female friend or something. I don't care to mention it, but you should consider it anyway. Customers come to buy things, not to beg, but their attitude is rude
		- German Aviation Offical (5.0⭐, 2024-10-28): The staff are very nice and sell quality products
		- Han Thanh (5.0⭐, 2024-12-28): There is an employee named Cuong who is very polite and works professionally

		- Mơ Mộng (5.0⭐, 2024-08-28): Happy and enthusiastic sales staff, quality goods, reasonable prices.
		- Tăng Tường Vy (5.0⭐, 2024-07-28): The staff are enthusiastic, dedicated, thoughtful, and know how to care for customers. Overall, they are satisfied
		- owen tayaki (2.0⭐, 2024-03-28): We recommend that Circle K review how to train employees at Branch 30/4 Tran Ngoc Que. The two times I visited this place, the staff's attitude was very bad. 1st time: when I came in, there were 2 people in the shift (1 male, 1 female). They welcomed me but continued to stand and talk to each other (content saying bad things about other employees and not caring whether other people heard or not). Are not). After handing out the bill, the male friend kept the bill and told me to go to the counter to receive the food, while the female friend prepared the food and looked at me like where was the bill with an unpleasant attitude until the male friend saw that and said he was keeping the bill???  Second time: still a male and female couple (not the two employees above). One person went into the warehouse to check the goods, and the other person stood outside to calculate the bill, but for some reason, I called out to her 3 times before the person at the counter finally looked at me. When I finished reading the order, I couldn't concentrate. I kept listening and paying attention to other things, making me reread the order 3 or 4 times. After asking a lot of questions, after making the food, the order was still wrong (even though the store was empty at that time and I was the only one ordering food).  A large chain store whose employees are so unprofessional!

		- Trình Tiến (1.0⭐, 2024-03-28): At about 10:00 a.m. on February 24, 2023, I went shopping with my friend. He stood to buy things while I sat outside waiting. I parked next to a car identical to mine. When the store employee saw me sitting in his car, he panicked and ran out as if he wanted to hit me until he saw his car still lying there and everyone was looking at me as if I had stolen something from him. Then he took his car inside and locked me, not knowing what that attitude was. It's thinking that I stole from my friend and after knowing that I didn't take it, I didn't even apologize when everyone was looking at me. I hope to receive your response

		- Bich Nhi (1.0⭐, 2023-03-28): The male employee on the evening of October 23, at 7:30 had a rude attitude, answering and asking customers rudely. I don't understand why when I go shopping happily, I get such an attitude :)
		- Quốc Khại Đoàn (1.0⭐, 2023-03-28): At 2am there is shopping.  I wanted to text momo but the operator said he didn't support me. I just asked you, can I transfer the money to my friend and help me pay in cash? I can't reply. Leave immediately. Too bad for a 1-star convenience chain. Please correct her behavior or kick her all out
		- Huỳnh Thị Thu Hiền (1.0⭐, 2024-09-28): Staff attitude is concave. 3:25 p.m. 😌 …
		- Thien Minh Nguyen (1.0⭐, 2023-03-28): The staff's service attitude is not good! When the food is out of stock, tell the customer that it's gone, but over here they make you stand in line and wait for who knows how long, then when you come to the order again, you tell them it's gone🙃 …
		- Zletko Freiberg (1.0⭐, 2021-03-28): The female employee at 1:30 p.m. this afternoon was very rude and ignorant. She requested to be cleaned up to avoid being known as circle k. Customers came first to buy a glass of water to take away, but they had to wait for it to finish counting before they could do it, and it was extremely deserted at noon. So, before buying dozens of cups of fresh milk and coffee, everyone put in fresh milk first and then poured some coffee on top. He poured the coffee in and then added the milk, so it was bad to drink it. There were a few times when I came in and saw that I liked my appearance. This boss lady, when I had a chance to meet her, was really slow and eager to act. This type of circle should be supervised or it will bring trouble in the future.

		- Ngân Đặng (1.0⭐, 2023-03-28): The male staff had an irritable attitude, the food was so bad after making it that it curled up there and if you didn't pay attention you wouldn't be able to get it, the service was so bad compared to other branches and yours first...
		- Thao Pham (5.0⭐, 2021-03-28): Delicious coffee. Cheap. Cool. I can sit and lap all day 🤭 …

		- Kha Trúc (1.0⭐, 2023-03-28): The service is so bad, even though it's open 24/24, when I go upstairs to buy something, I shout loudly and say "we're about to clean the floor" huh?? Why don't you clean up at first and have to wait for the guests to come up before yelling to come up and clean up?????? Also, when I asked if I could heat the food, I said yes, then the staff member threw the box of food into the microwave to make fun of me, acting like I didn't have money :))))))
