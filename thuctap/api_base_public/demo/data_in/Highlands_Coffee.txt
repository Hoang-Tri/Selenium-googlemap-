		- Athena Lin (4.0⭐, 2025-01-31): Nice place to chill with AC. Drinks are okay, they are very sweet but there are so many mosquitoes so DEET up!
		- Peter Collipp (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): I got the 20oz black coffee and espresso. Service was fast, bathrooms clean. And it was nice and air conditioned inside. They gave me a little tastey cookie 🍪  with my espresso. I like Highlands Coffee because the quality and service are consistent at all of the locations I've been to.
		- May Oppom (3.0⭐, 2025-03-31): no breakfast menu, even simple. not good customer service.
		- Thanh Tung Tong Hoa (5.0⭐, 2024-06-30): Thank a lot Highlands.We hope you will IPO successful
		- ชนกันต์ จิตมนัส (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Nice place to unwind.
		- Tôn Đặng (4.0⭐, 2024-04-30): Ok
		- Thuận Kay (4.0⭐, 2024-07-31): Good
		- BN Jap (4.0⭐, 2024-09-30): A cafe right at Mau Than intersection, rich coffee to suit my taste The shop is beautifully decorated, has open space, large parking lot, and also sells snacks. There are also souvenir stalls selling cute water bottles The drinks are diverse and quite delicious, the staff is also quite friendly The only downside is that the toilet is often clogged and does not handle odors well :) If you have a chance, everyone should experience it
		- Bút Chì Lửa (5.0⭐, 2024-08-31): The location is easy to find, spacious and airy. The drinks are in the same system so they are all delicious. The day I went was a weekday but it was very crowded. To accommodate my group, I had to wait a bit for a table to sit. The parking lot is large and can accommodate cars and motorbikes comfortably. If it's sunny, if you go by car, the staff will use a sunshade for the driver's window to cover the car. The staff are friendly, kind and thoughtful.
		- Nhi Nguyễn (4.0⭐, 2025-03-31): I booked in advance on the app so I could pick up the water quickly, but the restaurant that confirmed my order didn't prepare the water or anything. When I went back to the restaurant to pick it up, I still had to wait like a normal order. This is the second time.
		- Kienthuc Skincare (1.0⭐, 2024-10-31): Too impolite. Sweep trash straight into the faces of sitting guests. Abundant dust
		- Trung Quý Trần (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): It is one of the cafe systems loved by young people. Nice space, air-conditioned.
		- Tài Đại (4.0⭐, 2024-11-30): The restaurant is in a prime location so it's quite crowded. When you enter, you have to find a place yourself. If there is a staff member who asks to guide you to find a place, that would be great. The price is definitely not cheap.
		- Brian Nguyen (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The restaurant is spacious and air-conditioned. It's nice to sit here during hot lunches. Food and drinks are the same as other Highlands so I can't comment much.
		- Anh Luu Pham Thanh (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The space is spacious and airy, the music is just right.
		- GIANG HUYEN (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Wide space. There is parking for motorbikes and cars
		- Thanh B Nguyen (4.0⭐, 2024-12-31): The restaurant is right in the center so it's very crowded! Regarding quality, it's free, the system is standard!!
		- Lê Thị Thủy Tiên (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): In terms of quality, there's nothing to complain about, it's delicious. Enthusiastic staff. Comfortable space
		- Huỳnh Tới (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Today Go to Mercedes cf at Highlands Mau Than Can Tho. The staff also gave me a glass of brown ice. Feeling very happy 🙂. Huynh Go to Mercedes Can Tho 📞 0866.235.567
		- Toan Truong (5.0⭐, 2024-06-30): 1. Long-standing prime location of Can Tho. 2. Beautiful decoration, cool air conditioning.
		- Hữu Đức Trần (3.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The location right at the intersection is very nice, but the upper floors are always vacant, which is really a pity for such a prime location./.
		- Huy Tran (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Always like Highland's style and dishes. Especially the Almond Phindi
		- Chu Nguyen The Hoang (5.0⭐, 2024-04-30): Most of the drinks are as delicious as other Highlands branches in Can Tho City. The dish I like most is Golden Lotus Tea. Rich cream served with fragrant lotus seeds, the tea is brewed just right and not too sweet. Everyone can try. There are also cakes and cream puffs served. The restaurant space is clean, the staff is enthusiastic, and the dishes are accurate. There is quite a large motorbike parking lot. Parking for cars is relatively limited, so people can consider it.
		- bien dao (2.0⭐, 2024-09-30): 💥💥💥💥 𝗧𝗢̂̉𝗡𝗚 𝗛𝗢̛̣𝗣 𝗧𝗢𝗔̀𝗡 𝗕𝗢̣̂ 𝗠𝗔̃ 𝗚𝗜𝗔̉𝗠 𝗚𝗜𝗔́ 𝗛𝗜𝗚𝗛𝗟𝗔𝗡𝗗𝗦 𝗖𝗢𝗙𝗙𝗘𝗘 👉 Link to receive promotion: https://shorten.asia/sjkt2uqf Discount of 30,000 VND, for bills from 120,000 VND
		- Kenneth Bui (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The security guard did not guide customers to drive out, causing the driver to drive in the opposite direction and collide with a tree trunk!!
		- Cá Cảnh Tỷ Sóc Trăng (5.0⭐, 2024-09-30): Pate bread is better than chicken floss. Lotus tea drink 98 VND
		- Hoang Loi (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): - Good price, View of the central intersection
		- PHÒNG VÉ ÁNH SÁNG (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): This morning, February 7, at 9:34 a.m., I placed an order. The delivery staff was missing mineral water. When I asked, they charged me again. I looked at the bill and saw that there was a new order and no refund. I bought 2 bottles. Even when entering the restaurant, you can't use the napas card promotion because the staff said the bank's promotion is out of stock, not sure if that's right
		- Pauline Tran (1.0⭐, 2024-05-31): There is no place to go to the toilet here before the building opens. If I sit at a coffee shop from 8:00 a.m. to 8:40 a.m. to ask to go to the toilet, I ask the Highlands black-shirted guy who only goes around the back of the Vincom building. When I go out, I meet the vin security guard. The vin security guard doesn't let me in. I ask him to go back to the front. When he turns around and asks the Highlands black-shirted store manager, he doesn't care. In general, he sees a 5-month pregnant woman who doesn't help him. :((, the staff's attitude is bad, at least say I'm very sorry, or find another place, but here after the pregnant woman turned around and came back without a word of shyness.
		- Thu Sương (1.0⭐, 2024-11-30): Staff talks rudely and has an attitude
		- Dao Le Tan (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): He-lo-mo-to. Wish Ace a wonderful day and good luck.
		- Thanh Thien Nguyen (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): There is a slightly open car park, especially the staff outside the parking lot is very thoughtful, friendly, cheerful, polite and professional.
		- Gov Netflix (5.0⭐, 2024-05-31): It's delicious, it's hot and hot in the air-conditioned shop, the seats are spacious, all the staff are cute and active, ten points 🖐️🤚
		- Lil Nguyễn (3.0⭐, 2024-10-31): I don't understand why the air conditioner is always so cold
		- Nam Nguyen (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The security guards at Highland in Can Tho are really cute and welcoming. Better than Saigon. Like the way the Customer Reception staff (security guard) greets guests. If it's for the dedicated service, then surely if you have the opportunity to go to Can Tho, just stop by here
		- Admin BDS.NET (5.0⭐, 2024-08-31): The cafe location has a pretty good view of the city. Located at the root of the bustling central route of Can Tho
		- Phương Nguyễn (1.0⭐, 2025-01-31): Employees look down on customers!
		- Hiếu Trương (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): I ordered almond phindi but didn't see the jelly anywhere without first asking the staff to fix the dish.
		- Max Dang (2.0⭐, 2024-03-31): I am a regular customer of the highland chain. Lately, the staff is not as welcoming and smiling as before; The wifi is very weak, today there is no wifi but I don't see how to handle it, making many customers in the restaurant uncomfortable because many people need wifi to work on laptops.
		- Pham Trung (3.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The inside is spacious and clean but... the outside is disappointing. The outside and surrounding area is quite dirty. I'm a resident of the city and it looks really disappointing. I hope that after your comments, someone will be in charge. The management here is clean and hygienic to be worthy of Highlands in Can Tho city
		- Hieu Phan (3.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Your car looks so cute. Delicious drinks But the power outlet was completely damaged, I couldn't charge the laptop, so I replaced the power outlet
		- Hoài Tâm (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): After ordering, I sat and waited for more than 20 minutes. When I asked, I said I forgot to do it. Review how to serve customers.
		- Leo Nguyen (3.0⭐, 2024-04-30): I searched forever in the shop as well as in the yard but couldn't find the trash can!
		- long do nguyen (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Perfect coffee, airy shop...
		- THÚY LÊ NGỌC (1.0⭐, 2024-08-31): Not satisfied with the guard's attitude

		- nguyen my (3.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Several times I bought a very easy-to-listen nch staff, but now I've bought a very difficult-to-listen nch staff. I asked for frozen chocolate but now it's bitter.

		- Hwan Tian (2.0⭐, 2025-03-31): I went 4-5 times and every time there was no strawberry matcha even though I went to many different branches, in the end there was that dish to save customers time.

		- Nguyễn Quang Duy (1.0⭐, 2024-08-31): Braised beef noodles with delicious broth but the water is not hot enough to cook the fresh noodles. It makes the dish no longer delicious Before I finished eating, the staff asked me to pay first. Say the shop's rules
		- Chấn Long Tô (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): The restaurant is beautifully decorated, located right at the corner of a 4-way intersection, easy to find, the restaurant sells delicious breakfast food at reasonable prices, the restaurant is crowded but the food is served quickly, the staff serves well!

		- Nam Đào BÌnh Phương (4.0⭐, 2021-03-31): The shop has a good space, drinks are reasonably priced, but the music has bolero lyrics so it may not be suitable for some people. It is better to keep the songs without lyrics light and popular, better and suitable for more people. Hope the shop receives comments and makes changes.
		- Tien Diep (1.0⭐, 2024-11-30): Food comes out too slow and doesn't follow customers' wishes

		- linh nguyen (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The restaurant is spacious, a bit crowded on weekends. There is comfortable car parking. Delicious food, reasonable prices. Service staff is okay.
		- Quang Nguyễn Xuân (4.0⭐, 2022-03-31): There are two areas: cold room and outdoor. Price is a bit steep
		- Trung Hà (4.0⭐, 2020-03-31): New restaurant, airy, clean
		- PHUONG VO MINH (2.0⭐, 2025-01-31): Not enough large parking spaces
		- thanh tam (5.0⭐, 2024-08-31): Very delicious and beautiful view
		- Bảo Gia (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): I sat for more than 30 minutes and didn't ask for anything. I asked for x. Then I sat for more than 20 minutes and couldn't find any water. Table 49 is upstairs, right in Asia.
		- Minh Thùy Võ Nguyễn (1.0⭐, 2023-03-31): The shop is not suitable for people who want to protect the environment. The shop refuses to use glass cups in the cold room with the reason "so regulated" (the shop still has glass cups for use in other areas).
		- Nguyễn Hoàng (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The seafood noodle soup was watery, the vegetables served with bean sprouts and chives plus 2 pieces of lettuce that had a few stalks of bean sprouts and chives. Sighzzzz
		- Tuan Dang (1.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Students looking to work part-time should avoid this shop. My nephew asked to go to work for 7 days due to a change in school schedule, so he took a leave of absence. The shop owner doesn't always pay the wages.
		- Thẩm Đoàn Thanh Thân (5.0⭐, 2020-03-31): The restaurant is ok, the staff is enthusiastic and airy
		- Linh Nguyễn (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Airy space, delicious food, very satisfied with the staff's service
		- Sean Le (3.0⭐, 2021-03-31): The restaurant is built in the style of "Ruong Canh Thang" - quite unique, located on the street (if looking on the map) number 10 mixed with Vu Dinh Lieu in Nam Long area, Quan Cai Rang, Can Tho city.   In addition to the strange "Ruong Canh Thang" architecture of the restaurant, if you take a few laps around this Nam Long area, you will also realize a second UNIQUE and WEIRD thing: that is the way the party committee and local government number the streets, which the Can Tho working people will have to pay a large amount of tax to support and pay the cadres of the next few generations of the party and local government to change the way the streets are numbered in this Nam Long area. For example: you are lost on street number 1, but you want to find your relative's house on street number 2, it is not easy. If you ask the people on street number 1, very few, extremely few people know where street number 2 is to show you.   To be frank: the people who numbered and named the streets in this Nam Long area, as well as the people who approved the street names here - they are irresponsible with their work, do business arbitrarily, are uncultured or to put it bluntly: they are uneducated.  🍀🍀🍀 Back to the coffee! The coffee here is quite delicious. Reasonable prices. The staff are young - dedicated and polite (very active). There is an air-conditioned room upstairs but few people use it. The majority of coffee addicts sit downstairs with a pretty good ventilation system.  👍They serve breakfast here: pho, steak and a few other dishes that I don't remember. I had pho here - but the pho was not delicious and could be said to be bad. I haven't eaten the other dishes so I don't know. I don't know if they serve food at noon and in the evening.  In short, this is a pretty good place to drink coffee. The frontage is long and hugs the corner of the street, so parking is the most comfortable, especially for Bikers. Wish you all good health and good luck 🍀
		- Khôi Lê (1.0⭐, 2021-03-31): In the morning, two or three children asked for oppla bread, waited for 40 minutes but still got nothing, while those who came later all got food. I give it a bad rating. Table 11
		- Hama (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): The shop is ok
		- Khanh Long Tran (4.0⭐, 2021-03-31): The shop is very beautiful. Especially if you go at night, you will see the wonderful way the lights combine with the green color of the ornamental plants. Coffee is okay but not great. Delicious breakfast - a bit pricey.

It’s not the 5 star that I’m use to but is ok.  The breakfast wasn’t as good as the next door hotel but is ok.  I would stay here again the next time I visit the area.
		- Noel McConnon (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Had an ice coffee cookies and cream. Delicious. Not too sweet. English speaking staff. Clean.
		- Volkan Sakarya (5.0⭐, 2024-10-31): The second floor is my favorite place.
		- Ms. CaCO3 (5.0⭐, 2024-05-31): Nice local chain coffee. Starbuck of Vietnam, must visit
		- ATL (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Jealous young coffee seller guys, they thought I am a local and didn't like me drinking coffee here with my british friend!
		- Brian Collyer (1.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Unreliable service Last week no hot coffee (latte) Today no cold drinks available Music too loud makes it impossible to have a conversation.
		- Long Nguyễn (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Good
		- Nguyen Hau (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Good
		- Trí Dũng Nguyễn (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Good
		- Ethan Kang (5.0⭐, 2024-10-31): I like the riverside view in front of the hotel🏞.  The cafe is spacious and quiet.
		- Thái Nguyên (1.0⭐, 2024-04-30): Although the restaurant is close to the walking street, the food and drinks are okay. However, the restaurant is dirty, the staff does not clean and sanitize the restaurant, it is too dirty and unsightly for the restaurant and has an unfriendly look for customers. Hopefully the restaurant will fix it and the staff should pay attention to cleaning after customers leave the restaurant.
		- Huynh Hieu Travel (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The restaurant is located right at Ninh Kieu wharf, convenient for tourists. The space inside is quite ok, there is an upper floor with a clear view (But open from 9:00). Parking lot is ok, especially during the day there is a separate lock for motorbikes parked in front.
		- Alex Dương (5.0⭐, 2022-03-31): The shop has two floors! Both are air-conditioned rooms! Add a very airy design! View overlooking Ninh Kieu wharf, near the pedestrian bridge, but this section of Ninh Kieu wharf is quite deserted and sad. Coffee is like any other Highlands restaurant, the staff is quite cute and polite. Motorbike parking lot behind the shop.
		- Nguyễn Sơn (3.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Inside, the interior, model, and service are identical to other branches in the Highlands store chain. But the special point here is the location with a prime view of Ninh Kieu Wharf. From inside the restaurant, you can observe surrounding views such as the marina, TTC Hotel, NinhKieu Riverside, Walking Bridge (love bridge)... What I like here is to play quality music, loud but moderate, enough to drown out some of the noise emitted by diners and still hear the music clearly. Unlike some branches that play music so little you can't hear anything, but when the shop is crowded it's super noisy (for example, branch 3/2). Enthusiastic and cheerful staff. The shop has a floor to view the surrounding space from above, which is really chill.
		- Anh Pham (5.0⭐, 2021-03-31): ☕ The restaurant has a beautiful location, right at Ninh Kieu wharf, near the pedestrian bridge and the park. ☕ 2-storey air-conditioned restaurant, the upper floor is spacious, beautifully decorated, with views of the river and the street, the ground floor has a drink order counter and seating corners overlooking the river, the space is narrower than the upper floor. ☕ Polite and professional staff. ☕ The toilet is clean and beautiful ☕ Limited narrow motorbike parking lot, a bit difficult to get in and out of.
		- Mục Du (Đi & Đi) (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Highlands Coffee brand is so famous with Saigon residents, now expanding to other cities (possibly as a franchise brand) but always satisfying diners. Today the price has changed by 13%, please refer to it when purchasing.
		- Sandy Sandy (5.0⭐, 2024-12-31): I find the staff to be very enthusiastic and cute. I've never been ignored or ignored by the staff. Any customers who feel that the staff has an attitude should check to see if their attitude is right for the staff 👍🏻 (typically Mr. Trong Tran) employees are just students, the same age as your children and grandchildren, so don't be mean to them 🙏🏻 treat each other with Vietnamese people. Be a little kinder to each other so you can accumulate virtue for your children and grandchildren
		- ducky0128 (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Maybe I was lucky. There were a lot of empty seats when I arrived. I ordered my usual latte and chose a seat by the window. I stared in the direction of the park and watched the pedestrians and vehicles coming and going. I had a half-day of leisure.
		- Yuri Vo (4.0⭐, 2024-08-31): Pros: Right on Ninh Kieu walking street Cons: the restaurant is a bit small
		- duong dang thai (1.0⭐, 2024-12-31): Staff have an unpleasant attitude towards customers
		- van phi Nguyen (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): These past few days, I didn't want to stop by Highlands Coffee anymore, because we came here too many times while in Saigon. I was determined, so I walked around looking for a parking spot, and finally I landed here. Because the view is beautiful and the children serve enthusiastically.
		- Loan Le (4.0⭐, 2025-01-31): Welcoming the new year 2025
		- Toan Cao (4.0⭐, 2023-03-31): This coffee shop overlooking Ninh Kieu wharf is very good. Tourists who want to see Ninh Kieu wharf from above can choose this shop. The cafe is the same as the chain.
		- Hùng Phạm (5.0⭐, 2024-04-30): The restaurant has a beautiful view overlooking Ninh Kieu wharf, comfortable space, very chill in the afternoon
		- Quang Tri (3.0⭐, 2024-03-31): - The shop has comfortable parking, for both cars and motorbikes. - The location is right at Ninh Kieu wharf, if you sit next to the glass door you will have an interesting view outside - Drinks are the same throughout the chain (this is nothing to discuss) - The staff here are happy and enthusiastic, including the parking attendants - The air conditioner must often operate at full capacity, so it is often damaged and leaks water
		- Phong Nguyen (4.0⭐, 2024-12-31): This is one of the largest and highest hotel restaurants in the Ancient Capital of Can Tho...
		- Heo Sữa Ham Ăn (1.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Oder long. Long wait for water. If you accept the country, you're doing it wrong. The customer's order went away and the host did not clear it. I don't want to criticize, but I have to contribute this opinion
		- Lĩnh Nguyễn Trọng (Lĩnh Lĩnh) (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Highlands here is ok everyone, it's worth going. Lovely friendly staff
		- trucdao luu (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Delicious coffee, beautiful view right at Ninh Kieu wharf but the air conditioner is too cold, I hope the shop sees this contribution
		- NGUYỄN THỊ XUÂN LAN (1.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Service not yet available. From the parking attitude to the staff in the shop. Customers can serve themselves as staff carrying water to the place.
		- Đoàn Lộc (1.0⭐, 2024-08-31): I was a foreign customer who came into the store to drink a drink. The store's display of cards was not carefully positioned. I was about to leave when I bumped into the shelf and dropped a cup. The female employee spoke aggressively and seemed annoyed with me. Like I did it on purpose, I was forced to stop meeting with the manager when I refused to pay. His attitude didn't see me as a customer. The staff has many ways to solve problems with customers. I don't understand what the training team worked with. How to train employees 1 The staff talked to customers like that. I also came in to buy water, I accepted to pay for the damaged glass, so I am also a customer, but the staff still considered me a vandal and forced compensation. The staff also said that many people had the same problem. So that's a lot of compensation, so is the store intentionally arranging the store like that so that customers will knock over to get compensation? I also went in to buy water and pay for the incident, but I hope there are many ways to explain to customers. This is an employee's way of threatening and yelling 1 brand does that
		- Kim Binh Nguyen (1.0⭐, 2024-06-30): Staff attitude is extremely bad. Disdain for customers. Every dish I ordered was out of ingredients. Finally, I ordered the ice-blended Cookies. They told me to wait 20 minutes to get the dish because: "The shop has 2 mortars, if you want to grind your dish, you have to wash the mortar"???????? What does that mean ???
		- Thuan Bui (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): When it rains heavily, the car is flooded. There are parking lots on both sides of the road on weekend afternoons or there is no room. The service staff is quite good
		- Thanh Tuan (1.0⭐, 2023-03-31): If customers are allowed to serve themselves, the quality of the rest of the restaurant must be good, but like this, the staff passes by no matter how many times they don't pay attention to cleaning up old glasses on the customer's table. Furthermore, the wall socket had fallen out, and there were cigarette butts on the glass door. I don't know when, and I don't know if the shop banned smoking or not. Why is it still here? Looking at the photo, you will clearly see that it deserves 1*
		- Đức Minh (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Large space, view of Ninh Kieu river wharf
		- Trong Tran (1.0⭐, 2024-11-30): The coffee takes too long to brew, the staff's attitude is DISGUSTING
		- Vũ Nguyễn Nguyên (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Service staff are welcoming. Rooms are OK. Eating lunch on the 8th floor is too bad. Salty and spicy food, even though I also eat salty food, takes away the joy of relaxing and watching the river.
		- John Nguyen (5.0⭐, 2021-03-31): Nice shop. Clean. Nice view Happy staff
		- Đàm Nguyễn Tố Uyên (2.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The male staff serving at 10 p.m. March 17, 2024 had an unpleasant attitude. It took a little while to get cash but his face was frowning as if someone had eaten all of his belongings 😒
		- nguyễn phú (4.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Go on Sunday morning and there are still tables. Great.
		- rainie pan (1.0⭐, 2024-05-31): Staff does not know all the promotions to apply to customers, causing customers to lose their benefits when having vouchers
		- THIÊN TƯỜNG TRẦN (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Belonging to the Highlands Coffee system, the quality is quite uniform, located right in the most prime area of Can Tho: Ninh Kieu Wharf and walking street area, yacht wharf... The space is quite spacious with 2 floors, You should choose on the 2nd floor during the day to have quite a clear view. Suitable for sitting and drinking water after walking around Ninh Kieu wharf. Note that the stairs going to the upper floor are quite unstable! The shop needs to be repaired if it doesn't want customers to grab frogs and even bring trays of water when they go upstairs! (July 2023)
		- Hoàng Gia Nguyễn (2.0⭐, 2024-06-30): Ordered a few glasses but I waited as pictured
		- Line V. (2.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Cleanliness of the rooms to be reviewed according to European standards (stains on the carpet, hair in the bathroom), water leak on the carpet, bathroom faucet that is dismantling, balcony door that no longer closes. Noises +++ and external sounds until 24:00..... Rooftop restaurant: 5 unique dishes ordered, arriving at different times
		- Trọng Phúc Lý (4.0⭐, 2024-10-31): Nice view
		- Giang Nguyen (3.0⭐, 2023-03-31): The location of the restaurant is good, but both times I came to it on 2 different days in 2 days, it said it was not open upstairs. The restaurant has a beautiful view, so customers often choose to sit upstairs, while the number of customers at that time was already large, not empty. I don't know if it's because the management is frugal or because the staff is lazy to clean up.
		- Hoàng Uyên (1.0⭐, 2023-03-31): The parking staff's attitude is very bad, they always run out of parking space and talk nonsense while chatting happily with other customers. When they leave, they don't help the car but walk for another customer even though they go out once and their car is closer.
		- Thịnh Mập (1.0⭐, 2022-03-31): Don't post in advance, but instead only accept customers who book tables in advance!! The staff dares to say that they posted it on the panpage!! The parking lot doesn't have a staff to guide you, which hurts the customer and he doesn't know where to park his car so he goes in behind another customer!! Can't give 0 stars!! Business where employees cheat!!
		- thuân đang học (4.0⭐, 2023-03-31): During the day there will be room for cars, and in the evening it will be very crowded so not having room for cars is a bit inconvenient. Besides, the location is very good so you can watch the yachts.
		- Phuong Duong (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Taking the stairs upstairs is quite dangerous, causing many people to trip and fall You should consider adding letters or signs
		- Đất Tây Đô Travel (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): The shop is nice and clean. View of Ninh Kieu Wharf (right at Can Tho floating restaurant) Famous brand

		- Anh Quí Lê (4.0⭐, 2025-03-31): Space: Spacious. Staff: Enthusiastic. Drinks: Stable quality like other branches. Note: The shop is too noisy during peak hours, making conversation difficult. If you plan to meet or chat, choose a time with fewer guests for a more comfortable experience.
		- An Long Nguyen (3.0⭐, 2025-03-03): Haha was forced to stop by, but who comes from Ho Chi Minh City to need poetry to drink higland
		- Long Hoàng Châu (5.0⭐, 2024-10-31): Airy, cool, can see the streets with a beautiful location. There is a place to charge cell phones and computers. Drinks like other HLCs.
		- ngoc chan (5.0⭐, 2025-01-31): Cool atmosphere, good service
		- Dante Lu (4.0⭐, 2024-10-31): The music is very loud and can overwhelm the space. The shop should play more appropriate music in terms of volume and genre so that customers who come to use the service will feel more comfortable and will come back more often. Please pay attention
		- Be Tam Phan Thi (1.0⭐, 2024-10-31): On the entrance door, it was said to close at 11:20 p.m., but around 10:20 p.m. (October 10, 2024), the staff came to say the shop was closed and then 10 minutes later, the bar staff disconnected the wifi network and a male staff member wearing glasses in the counter had a joking attitude with another staff member. First time going to coffee here and having such a poor experience, the staff attitude is so bad. Will contact the hotline to directly respond to handle!
		- hoàng dũng trần (1.0⭐, 2024-10-31): The service attitude is very bad.....poor awareness....It closes at 11am but at 10:30 there is a reminder to tell customers to go home.... A little while in the middle of business, the restaurant turns off the wifi to chase away customers.... everyone stands up to leave and the staff looks on and smirks.
		- Nguyễn Thắng (5.0⭐, 2025-01-31): Nv is so cute, I can't stop by car.  If you bring it to the car for me, you will be very happy and enthusiastic
		- Mai Thành Phương (5.0⭐, 2024-09-30): Today, the employee standing outside the umbrella in front of the shop was very helpful. Warm and friendly.
		- Kỳ Anh (1.0⭐, 2024-07-31): The shop closed at 11:20 p.m. When I arrived at 10:22 p.m., the staff said it closed at 11:30 p.m. and stopped taking orders at 10:30 p.m., meaning they didn't want to sell to me. I went to another branch about 4km away and they sold it again. So what the hell is wrong with this branch??
		- Mỹ Hạnh Phạm (5.0⭐, 2024-05-31): The restaurant space is bright, clean, beautiful, comfortable, with a view of the street and traffic. When it's full, the restaurant is a bit noisy. Delicious drinks, delicious cakes, newly added PhinDi Ice Cream that is moderately fatty, sweet, and fragrant with coffee. Friendly and enthusiastic staff.
		- Quyen Nguyen (5.0⭐, 2024-05-31): Today I had a bad experience at the restaurant. The restaurant needs to train staff better to have a better welcome and service attitude. I still give the restaurant 5 stars because the drinks are delicious and the view is beautiful.
		- Lê Bách (1.0⭐, 2024-07-31): The designer should be fired. The shop is small, the ceiling is low, yet it has 5 ceiling mounted air conditioners venting down. There is no place where your hands are not freezing cold. Tell the staff to increase the temperature but the staff says it cannot be increased!????
		- Thích Sút xa (1.0⭐, 2024-07-31): The service attitude is so bad that when I close at 11:10 p.m., I go in at 10:10 a.m. and the staff says they don't accept drink orders at the restaurant. The service attitude is so bad that when I travel, I feel like I'm losing to the restaurants in my hometown.
		- Chu Nguyen The Hoang (5.0⭐, 2024-04-30): The restaurant is located at the corner of 3/2 Street and Tran Hoang Na Street. The location is quite crowded and bustling. However, if you travel by car, you should consider it because there are very few parking spaces. Motorcycles are comfortable. The restaurant space is spacious, clean, the staff is enthusiastic and serves accurate dishes. The drinks are still delicious as usual, there are snacks like cakes and bread, suitable for families with young children or friends and colleagues who need a place to meet and exchange work.
		- Chu Hiếu (4.0⭐, 2024-09-30): Good coffee shop, stable quality, well-trained staff
		- Thúy Huỳnh Lưu (4.0⭐, 2024-08-31): The space is a bit small, the food and drinks are up to HT standards so don't discuss it, the staff is quite good
		- Trần Xuân Hiệp (5.0⭐, 2025-03-31): Good location, spacious, lots of parking

		- Jean Gilles De Ochandiano (5.0⭐, 2024-09-30): Simple and nice place.
		- Ý Đỗ (1.0⭐, 2025-03-28): The staff's attitude is terrible. There is a buy 1 get 1 free discount code but the attitude is like a beggar. When I bought a cup of lychee jelly, the big cup got 1 lychee but the small cup only had jelly and no lychee.

		- Trân (5.0⭐, 2024-06-30): One of my favorite Vietnamese brand name coffee shop in Vietnam and as well as in Can Tho. I always order PhinDi hạnh nhân as my favorite drink here. Parking is small and free but I did not see any security guys when I last was there, I had to park my motorbike myself.
		- Cillian Lynskey (4.0⭐, 2025-03-31): Reliable place for good coffee and comfortable
		- Tôn Đặng (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Ok
		- Phạm Kim Trân (4.0⭐, 2024-12-31): I gave the restaurant 5 stars 10 months ago. Actually, the frequency I come to this restaurant is very high. I like the space here. When it comes to drinks, the Highlands system already has the standards. However, recently I feel like the restaurant's staff is having problems. They don't seem to respect customers, from not saying hello, taking the bill, giving them the bill and wait card, not saying thank you, and then when making drinks. The boss was waving tools very loudly, the guys were laughing and talking, sweeping the trash was not very subtle in front of the guests, the toilet was very dirty and the sink was clogged and no one cared.... I read it briefly from the female employee. His name is Nghi, his face is very cute but I can see the above attitudes from you. I care about space, so it's not because of the unpleasant things about the staff that I don't come here anymore, but I think it's a contribution so the shop owner can read and adjust his staff. All the collapse of business has human resources contributing the most, especially this service industry!
		- Do Quynh Nhu (5.0⭐, 2025-01-31): I'm a fan of Highlands from SG. Quality is unquestionable
		- Hồng Tử (1.0⭐, 2025-03-31): It was only 10 o'clock when they closed, but the customers were already clearing the tables as if chasing away customers. The staff glanced sideways and sideways.
		- ngoc chan (5.0⭐, 2025-01-31): The restaurant is large, this side is quieter and more beautiful
		- Duy Trí Nguyễn (5.0⭐, 2024-12-31): The restaurant is clean, comfortably decorated, spacious, and the staff is lovely
		- Minh Xuân Nguyễn Trần (1.0⭐, 2025-03-31): I ordered the product in a small size, and then the store put it in a plastic bag with no bottom, but the bag's ring was wider than the rim of the glass. As soon as the shipper delivered it, it slipped out of the bag and spilled out
		- Đàm Võ Bửu Trân (5.0⭐, 2025-03-17): The drink is delicious and suitable for taste. The restaurant is clean and airy, especially with a super view facing the lake. Enthusiastic and agile staff
		- Sơn Trang Trần (5.0⭐, 2025-03-10): HL morning, HL afternoon 😁 Today there is nothing to criticize
		- ngoc duong Truong (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): All are great! The only thing is that the bartenders at the counter do things like smashing things, even making diners startled! Just brandishing machines, mills, etc. like a ball on the diners' heads!
		- Trần Hữu Nghĩa (4.0⭐, 2024-12-31): Beautiful location, quiet and airy space... The staff is also agile, the number of customers here is also a bit sparse compared to other places.
		- Diệp Linh Trần Nữ (Ạc Linh TV) (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Delicious drinking water. Friendly and attentive staff. The shop is located on the shore of the lake so it's very cool around 5 o'clock in the afternoon.
		- Chu Nguyen The Hoang (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Open space, opposite is Xang Thoi Lake blowing cool air in the early morning and evening. There is a cold room at noon, spacious and comfortable seating. Suitable for meeting friends and family. Delicious drinks. I used yellow lotus tea, which was quite delicious, the cream was not too fatty, and had lotus seeds that were rich, fatty, and fragrant. Recommend everyone should try. Diverse menu. In the morning, cakes and breadsticks are sold.
		- Nguyễn Sơn (4.0⭐, 2024-04-30): Just like any other highlands. But here there is a view of the lake!! 🍹🍹🍹
		- Thuận Phát Nguyễn (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The shop is small, quiet, beautifully designed, the space on the shore of Huynh Cuong lake is quite chill. Product quality is consistent with the entire Highlands Coffee system, friendly and professional staff from parking, instructions on choosing dishes, applying discount codes and different forms of payment.
		- ngan le (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Highlands is so familiar to many young people. For those who are passionate about highlands living in Can Tho, I will give you a review of a new location of highlands coffee, Huynh Cuong Street, a location with a view of the lake. I really like it, it feels cool, however, during CAN THO's flooding season, the road in front of the highlands is flooded quite deeply. When the water recedes, that section is still flooded a bit. Highlands Coffee Huynh Cuong will be a place I will visit more often in the future.
		- hoang lam (4.0⭐, 2025-03-10): The location of the shop is very chill
		- LM Ngọc (930) (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): delicious water, It's okay for staff to lighten the trash. The room was cold and noisy, really annoying

		- Ngọc Đổ (1.0⭐, 2024-10-31): Freeze green tea today is very strange, staff attitude is not ok
		- Lê Thị Thủy Tiên (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): With a great view, the price is reasonable and the space is airy. Enthusiastic staff from A to Z. Play music at appropriate volume. The number of visitors is not too much
		- Đàm Võ Bửu Trân (4.0⭐, 2024-04-30): Cafe with medium space, airy view of Hau River park. Suitable for chatting with groups, not very suitable for studying and working
		- Phượng Dương (5.0⭐, 2024-07-31): Large restaurant, comfortable parking, OK space
		- Ngót Trương (1.0⭐, 2024-10-31): At about 1:20 p.m. on October 27, Nam's staff behaved towards guests. Oder customers had questions so they asked but the staff laughed as if they looked down on them. Maybe it's because I wear casual clothes that I get caught easily :)))
		- HAI VU (1.0⭐, 2024-12-31): GOING TO DRINK CAFE IS LOST MONEY AND IT'S LIKE BEGGING. HOWEVER, THE SECOND TIME OF VISITING TO DRINK THE CAFE ON THE STREET FOR 20K IS EVEN MORE DELICIOUS, THERE IS ICE TEA, THERE IS SOMEONE SITTING IN AND SETTING UP, THERE IS A MUST ODER.
		- QUOC KHAI TRAN (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Highlands Coffee Song Hau •••• - The location is quite airy and spacious - View of Hau river and Phu park - The morning is quite deserted and quiet. - It's great to go jogging in the morning and then sit down for coffee ☺️
		- Anh Luu Pham Thanh (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): New shop, beautiful space, fragrant atmosphere, lovely staff
		- Thuyngan Tran (1.0⭐, 2025-03-31): Bad experience, poor service staff. Order this dish as another dish
		- Hiển Trương Cao Quang (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Frozen green tea still has a lot of ice cubes. It happened 3 times. I told the staff but there was no improvement. After drinking it for a while, I got a big lump that was very uncomfortable.
		- Huynh Nhu Nguyen (3.0⭐, 2024-06-30): The staff are cute, the shop is bustling, the space is comfortable
		- Quang Tri (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): _ The restaurant is clean, airy, and beautifully decorated _ View of Hau River park is very relaxing

		- Dương Thanh Phong (4.0⭐, 2025-01-31): Cool.
		- Krystal Nguyen (2.0⭐, 2024-04-30): The limited distance between the men's and women's restrooms is annoying. Makes it easy for people with poor awareness to go to a bathroom that doesn't match their gender with the excuse that the other room is already occupied, despite warnings. I think the reason is not that people lost consciousness, but mainly the lack of clear separation of the shop. I find this very offensive.
		- Lý Nhân (1.0⭐, 2024-12-31): Staff attitude when customers use vouchers
		- Nguyen Tang Khanh (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Coffee is increasingly losing quality compared to price, no aroma, no aftertaste. Poor service, staff on the evening shift on January 14, 2024 were superficial, there was a lucky draw program but no announcement. When the shop runs out of change, customers don't take the initiative to exchange it even when there aren't too many customers. The staff would rather refuse the order instead of sending someone to exchange money while the customers don't have any change. Customer Service is too poor compared to a big brand and the price is this high. As someone who loves Highland, I cannot accept it. When the restaurant staff saw new customers jumping in line, they didn't remind them and directly ordered them first even though they saw our group arriving before and waiting in line for a long time. The toilet is also dirty, tissues and trash are thrown everywhere and no one cleans it up. Everything is so bad, our group cannot accept it
		- Phương Vy Nguyễn Minh (1.0⭐, 2024-05-31): The staff always has an attitude no matter how many times they come, the staff changes but still has the same attitude.
		- Phan Ngọc Thảo Vy (1.0⭐, 2024-04-30): The water was very light and I didn't think it was tea. The water took a while to come out, it took 20 minutes. Disappointed
		- Vu Phung (3.0⭐, 2024-06-30): The restaurant is noisy, the staff does not remind customers and is indifferent.
		- Hội Làm Xoài Bền Vững (3.0⭐, 2024-12-31): It's okay... Self-service..

		- Thái Đoàn (1.0⭐, 2023-03-31): no employees willing to clean previous customer's leftovers, peach tea was a bit blech, overall 6/10 second time come back to this place, no restroom, outdoor atmosphere was dull.

		- Anh Mai (5.0⭐, 2024-11-30): The first time I experienced here, I had a pretty good impression. The ordering staff and waiters were very enthusiastic. That day, I had a small child with me, and the male staff member proactively took the seat cushions and arranged chairs for my family to let the baby lie down on. ! The shop owner should reward her for her thoughtfulness and enthusiasm!
		- Lee December (3.0⭐, 2024-05-31): I went with 2 people, ordered 1 drink and 1 ice cream but the staff seemed annoyed because they didn't order 2 drinks. Lychee tea doesn't taste much, it tastes like sugar water.
		- Nghi Nguyen (5.0⭐, 2025-03-31): Enthusiastic staff, quick service. Space is a bit cramped and hot.
		- Minh Hiền Nguyễn (5.0⭐, 2024-05-31): Airy space. Delicious drinks. Polite and attentive staff.
		- Hưng Nguyễn Quốc (1.0⭐, 2024-11-30): When a customer sits down to drink coffee, the employee uses a broom to sweep around and right under the foot of the table where the customer is sitting. It's like chasing customers away with an uncultured and unconscious action
		- Hạnh Dung Ngô (5.0⭐, 2020-03-31): I like this Legend the most out of all Trung Nguyen in Can Tho. Every time I come here, I really enjoy the space and drinks. Legend Xuan Khanh is always the ideal place whenever I need a place to read quietly and have personal space.
		- COMI · Thanh Lý Ký Gửi (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): I don't judge whether the drinks are good or not because I mainly come here because I like the open space, sitting outside looking at the crowded street.  It's almost Christmas, so Vincom is crowded with people taking photos with the Christmas tree. Another bustling year-end festival season is coming.
		- Mỹ Hạnh Phạm (4.0⭐, 2021-03-31): Large, airy, slightly noisy space for those who study or work. I often drink Phindi Almond, sweet and not harsh like milk coffee, rich and fragrant with almond scent. Delicious tuna sandwiches.
		- Dung Hồ (5.0⭐, 2020-03-31): The service staff is quite cheerful, welcoming, friendly, the view of the residential area and streets are beautiful... Having a discount program without telling customers in advance makes people unaware...
		- Nguyễn Hoài Thương (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Easy to find location, beautiful view in the morning and afternoon to watch the cars go by Fast, attentive and enthusiastic staff
		- Dinh Le (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The space is messy, hot and the air conditioning doesn't seem to work except for a few fans. Staff are rude and not as friendly as other branches.
		- 20 Hùng Vương Cơ Sở VỎ XE A LẬP (5.0⭐, 2024-05-31): Mulberry rattan ice cream tastes very good, not greasy like green tea and not too sweet
		- Hoàng Châu (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Delicious matcha with fatty swirl ice. Chocolate is also delicious, lemongrass peach tea, peach jelly tea are also delicious.
		- Minh Đông Đỗ (5.0⭐, 2019-03-31): Delicious drinks, especially famous Highlands coffee <3  🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉  The service staff is lovely, cute, polite and enthusiastic, the space is beautiful, airy and luxurious!  It is suitable to go alone or in groups, there are outdoor tables and chairs depending on each person's preferences...  🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
		- Lập Cr (3.0⭐, 2023-03-31): I checked on the map and the time on the map was 11:00 p.m. closing time, but around 10 p.m. the staff said it was closed. Not very satisfied with this issue.
		- Trang Nguyễn (5.0⭐, 2020-03-31): The shop is beautiful, clean, with 2 sides facing the street and the shophouse area.
		- Na Nguyễn (3.0⭐, 2021-03-31): + Combo of 1 green tea, 1 lotus tea, 1 cake is 105k (size S) + strong wifi. The restaurant is luxurious and bright. + matcha cheese cake is very delicious. Medium fatty taste, not too sweet.  - The staff asked the customer if the size was S, would he like to upgrade it to a more comfortable size? The customer said no, but kept asking as if forcing the customer. Customers still choose size S, and the service attitude is a bit unpleasant. - This is the same for every branch. Drinking at the bar but still using plastic cups. Not environmentally friendly.
		- Phương Lý (3.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Delicious drinking water. Prices were already high and now they're going up again. Only suitable for experience. It's okay to go once in a while.
		- Nguyen Duc Lap (2.0⭐, 2021-03-31): 10:00 am The restaurant is crowded and extremely hot. Probably due to not being able to be proactive because of the space of the shopping center. Customers consider this issue when coming here. Very ridiculous. 🤧
		- Oskar Nguyen (4.0⭐, 2021-03-31): Drinks are good, prices are ok, nice view.
		- Yen Nhi Huynh (5.0⭐, 2019-03-31): There's no need to discuss the quality of drinking water in the Highlands. Coffee is rich and fragrant. Luxurious space, beautiful decor. Professional staff. There is an outdoor area and air conditioning. I myself often drink tea and coffee, but for some reason, drinking Highlands milk coffee keeps me up until 3am. Overall 9/10
		- QUANG PHU QUOC (4.0⭐, 2018-03-31): The restaurant is spacious and beautiful in a common Highland style
		- hoang nghia dang (5.0⭐, 2020-03-31): Delicious drinks, good service staff
		- Thanh Khánh Nguyễn (5.0⭐, 2024-07-31): Recognize 5 stars for the restaurant Good coffee Staff and store managers are enthusiastic, cheerful, and provide professional service Drink regularly and support Highland at this location!
		- Như Bình Bùi Thị (1.0⭐, 2024-06-30): Order Freeze chocolate and the staff clicks on Phindi. The first time a male ordered, I reminded him, but the male who was ordering left and gave another person the order. I came first but you guys ordered for the next one, but the second time you still clicked on Phindi. The female counter who pressed the bill had a very bad attitude.
		- Nghĩa Trần (5.0⭐, 2021-03-31): Delicious drinks, prices consistent with attitude and service quality, comfortable space.
		- thanh nguyendac (4.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Quite ok, the restaurant is quite crowded
		- Chu Hiếu (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Good place for morning and evening coffee

		- DAO HUY (5.0⭐, 2025-03-17): Everything is the same place
		- Nha Y Tran (4.0⭐, 2020-03-31): The price is a bit high but the bread here is very delicious Worth a try
		- Lý Phương Nam (4.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Coffee is ok, there is underground parking
		- An Rùi (5.0⭐, 2019-03-31): Very good. The scenery is very beautiful :33
		- Kai Henry (4.0⭐, 2025-03-31): Spacious parking area
		- Lân Lê (3.0⭐, 2024-03-31): In the morning there is no air conditioning, the toilet has to be far away. At 9:30 a.m., air conditioning and related doors will be opened.
		- Tỉnh Thức Trần (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): I often hunt for great deals at Highland Coffee, so many times I get to drink dishes at quite bargain prices. Highland Coffee here has a romantic, peaceful, beautiful view. I just sat and worked while looking at the scenery outside. Unfortunately, the space was a bit cramped and hot, tables were fighting over fans, and the ladies and gentlemen were talking quite loudly. Hopefully Highland Coffee's branches will quickly fix the air conditioning problem and it'll be ok.
		- Phung Lam (4.0⭐, 2020-03-31): Highlands is a very famous brand, delicious drinks but quite expensive.
		- Thơ Nguyễn (2.0⭐, 2024-03-31): I have used many Highlands branches, but this time I was a bit disappointed with the Freeze Tra Xanh dish. Matcha taste is lighter than other branches, not rich in flavor, less fragrant. Hope it will be fixed.
		- trang hoai hung (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Cold breadsticks. CHEESE Delicious drinks.
		- Han Nguyen (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Highlands fan here, let's have a cup of coffee
		- Hoài Bảo Trương (4.0⭐, 2018-03-31): Delicious drinks, professional service
		- Trung Quý Trần (5.0⭐, 2021-03-31): The restaurant is crowded. delicious drinks,
		- Triều Dương (4.0⭐, 2020-03-31): An ideal place to stop after walking in the commercial area
		- Vu Phung (1.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Staff lack customer care, take a long time to resolve, and are unprofessional. I waited for the customer to order for about 5 minutes, the shop was just me and her. Once you're done dealing with her, go inside. I also like HL but now I'm disappointed!
		- Minh BT (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): The space is airy, stylish, eye-catching and comfortable. Polite, enthusiastic staff, professional service. Diverse drink menu, many choices, typical highland coffee taste. Come and experience your lifestyle.
		- Phương Cao (4.0⭐, 2018-03-31): Drinking water is better than on Hoa Binh Avenue. Spacious space and friendly staff
		- Lê Văn (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): This shop has a very wide view, there is a very chill outside seat in front of Vincom
		- Troy Shino (4.0⭐, 2019-03-31): Good experience, quick service with waiting card and large space...
		- Phong Le Loi (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Beautiful space, very professional service, car parking. Both have outdoor space and air-conditioned space. Convenient to buy
		- RITAJ LOK (1.0⭐, 2023-03-31): The staff attitude here is very unpleasant. Another thing is the same discount voucher that some people can use and some people can't. I'm told that Highlandland can be used elsewhere but not here. Does the staff at HighLand look down on customers? Or is it just this place?
		- Khoa Lưu (4.0⭐, 2024-08-31): The characteristic of Highland bars is that they are very noisy.
		- Ngô Huỳnh Trang (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Highland service ok. Located in a commercial area, the entrance + toilet is limited when it's not yet time.
		- Trần Trọng Anh Tuấn (5.0⭐, 2021-03-31): Delicious drinks and cakes.
		- BUKI (3.0⭐, 2020-03-31): Why don't we turn on the air conditioner when it's hot?  Coffee is delicious. Haha
		- nguyen long hung (5.0⭐, 2020-03-31): Airy, beautiful scenery, suitable for weekend relaxation
		- Địa Thổ (4.0⭐, 2020-03-31): It's too quiet, bro
		- Jaku Bui (4.0⭐, 2019-03-31): As always! Highlands is Highlands! But it's beautiful here!
		- Thêm Nguyễn Út (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Today I stopped by Highlands Vincom Xuan Khanh Can Tho to buy 2 cups of coffee. Because I was in a hurry, I forgot my credit card. Actually, I wasn't sure where I left it, so I searched and called each place I visited. Luckily, after the employee specifically asked for his full name to confirm the owner, he confirmed that he had picked it up and asked for it. The support address sent it to me, even though I live in Ca Mau. I would like to send my sincere thanks to all of you at Highlands Vincom Xuan Khanh!
		- Nhật Duy Nguyễn Huỳnh (3.0⭐, 2020-03-31): Drinks are the same as other Highland bars. However, the seats are old, worn, threadbare, and sitting in a restaurant without a fan will be very uncomfortable. Spending a reasonable price to use a service with such seats is difficult to accept
		- Sơn Nguyễn Hoàng (5.0⭐, 2020-03-31): The space is quite ok, the outside space is very comfortable to sit in the evening. Sipping a cup of coffee while watching people pass by is very suitable for relaxing or gathering with friends. Here, unlike the Mau Than Highlands, it is quite noisy. I feel more like sitting here.
		- mộng quỳnh trương (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Cool location
		- nhân nguyễn trọng hiền (5.0⭐, 2019-03-31): Located in a corner of Vincom Xuan Khanh, there is a car parking space and a separate entrance without going through Vincom. However, if you visit in the morning, you can go to the toilet after 9:30 :)
		- Syeol Jinn Won (1.0⭐, 2020-03-31): I'm a big fan of HighLands :)))) every day I go to practice and come down to drink at least 1 glass of iced milk filter :)))) many of the staff are super cute! But I really don't want to say anything, so I think HL needs to retrain some of the staff? What's wrong with glancing at the customer, having an attitude towards the customer and then pointing at the customer? =)))) ???? It's not good for men to do that =)) Is it possible that I was carrying a tray of drinks and cakes and I threw it in that employee's face right on the spot?

		- Thomas Croteau (5.0⭐, 2025-03-31): What a beautiful place to relax with a coffee … this is the type of cafe I was looking for
		- Trang Thach (3.0⭐, 2024-03-31): This place has such a cute esthetic. But our waiter needs some training. He forgot 1 of our coffee's & pho. When we asked him about the coffee, he made up some lame excuse about the water not working. I went up to the bar area and the lady told us we only ordered 1 coffee. Then she looked so confused when I asked her to make us another 1. It took a really long time for them to get us the coffee so I ran across the street to get my own coffee in the middle of breakfast. Also, the food was mediocre. 1 time experience
		- Mr. RA THA (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): This is a nice coffee! I love this place!
		- Joseph Nannariello (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Best hot cappuccino in Can Tho Best I have had in all my many visits to VietNam
		- Bành Hào (5.0⭐, 2024-10-31): Ok
		- Thang Ton (5.0⭐, 2025-03-31): Good place
		- Huy Nguyễn Đình (5.0⭐, 2025-03-31): Nice seats. The space of the restaurant is decorated very similar to the name of the restaurant like the Highlands. The brewed coffee is delicious, I drink it very well. Next time come and support 👍
		- GOOGLE Riview (5.0⭐, 2024-09-30): Nice shop without cold room, garden style, quite high prices. Like the very clean Tolet.
		- Phạm Văn Vững (5.0⭐, 2024-11-30): Very nice space :) nice view, delicious drinks... Thank you restaurant
		- Trúc Khanh Đào (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): This is the second time I came here, and just like the first time, I feel like the restaurant has a very different vibe from the restaurants now. The two times I went were 5 or 6 years apart but the quality of the restaurant is still the same, from the decor. until the drink. Every corner of the restaurant in the photo is very beautiful, the drinks are a bit expensive but delicious. In general, after a while of going to self-ordering and bringing your own water, when you come here, the staff comes to the table to order and bring the water, showing that you don't like it at all. I don't know when I will visit the restaurant again, but I will definitely recommend my friends and acquaintances to come here to experience it, the restaurant is really impressive. Well, if you want to live a virtual life, you should go early in the morning or in the afternoon with light sunshine for better photos. I took this photo around 3 or 4 pm.
		- Trần Hân Hân (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The cafe is built in the style of a castle on the highlands. The scenes are all very poetic and beautiful. The space is large, airy and cool with green trees and a lake. Price is a bit high. The service staff is professional but not cheerful.
		- Isa Labrunette (5.0⭐, 2025-03-26): Very beautiful, peaceful and very harmonious space. Don't miss this refreshing place with its water jets. We feel out of time and out of the city.
		- Linh Giang (3.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The shop has created a scene in the space in the middle of the shop. Drink prices are a bit high. The taste of the water is okay, a little too much milk, a lot of sweet cream. Like the music of the shop, the music suits 8x taste. Enthusiastic and friendly staff.
		- Kristin Eichler (4.0⭐, 2025-03-31): Unfortunately, there was no food offered on the day I was there. Drink (had a dragon tea on ice) was okay. The café is really something to look at... great evening atmosphere with the lights and fountains.
		- Anh VU QUOC (5.0⭐, 2024-04-30): The cafe is beautiful, spacious and very chill. Suitable for all ages. This is the nth time coming to Can Tho but it feels very good!!!

		- Lê Thanh Nhã (1.0⭐, 2024-04-30): The shop is dirty Selling is expensive The customer's iced tea box is placed near the broom and dustpan Detention staff salary for 15 days But still late

		- YC Li (5.0⭐, 2025-03-31): Perfect atmosphere, best espresso in CTC.
		- SG Genius (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Nice coffee and service. Heaven when fit together with a meal.
		- Bánh Cờ Rếp Nhượng Quyền (5.0⭐, 2022-03-31): Ok
		- con soi (5.0⭐, 2024-12-31): I like drinking yellow lotus tea the most. The shop at this address has a spacious parking lot. In the HL chain, everywhere is cool. Prices are the same as other places in the same chain. But it's wide here and right on the main road
		- Xuân Mai Lưu (1.0⭐, 2024-10-31): Normally, my friends and I love to visit Highland to sit and chill, but many times there are families who bring their children along but don't control their children at all. They just sit and talk while the children run around screaming loudly. One time the children played with paper airplanes and hit me in the head. Neither the parents nor the staff had any supervision over the children. And today is the weekend, wanting to enjoy the weekend, these loudspeakers scream and run loudly around the shop. I strongly recommend that the management tell the staff to remind families with young children not to let their children scream and run around like that, it will greatly affect the experience of everyone around them. Entering Highland and accepting higher water prices than other places means wanting to exchange for the best experience and space. Today I couldn't sit for more than 1 hour because the children kept screaming and it hurt my ears and head, and the staff continued to act normally without reminding me. As for the parents, there's no need to talk...just sit there and chat no matter who's upset 🙂 We hope that Highland's superiors will note this situation and take measures to remind parents to manage their children so as not to affect everyone's experience at Highland.
		- Chính Vũ (5.0⭐, 2024-06-30): When I wake up in the morning, I run here to buy coffee, because I only drink Highlands Coffee. This place has spacious space and an outdoor yard for those who smoke. Cars can park comfortably.
		- Huỳnh Như Lê (5.0⭐, 2024-11-30): wide space There is a new dish called taro jelly which is quite delicious
		- Nguyen Hoang Yen Oanh (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Needless to say, the quality of drinks at Highlands is excellent, 80% of the menus I've tried are delicious and have their own flavors. My favorite drinks here are almond phindi, milk cream phindi, lychee tea and peach tea.  I stopped by the shop this evening (January 31, 2024) and unexpectedly met the staff and security guards who were all cute, enthusiastic and had good attitudes.  This is the second time I've visited Nguyen Van Cu branch. Although it's a bit far from where I live, I feel like coming here is worth it because I really like the space at this branch.
		- H Tran (5.0⭐, 2025-03-31): The shop is located on the center street, the drinks are delicious, wait about 10-20 minutes.
		- Khắc Thắng Sử (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Okie water, delicious bread, parking space. When I looked at the reviews, no one talked about the dauxe place. So I took a note to let the next person know that they can pass, so they can stop by
		- Anna Nguyen (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The staff is thoughtful, careful, enthusiastic, friendly, and easy-going. If you accidentally spill a new glass of water on a stack of documents, the staff who cleans, wipes, and brings out a new glass of water to clean the stack of documents is probably only here.
		- Hoài Thương Channel (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The space is large and airy. Strong coffee, enthusiastic staff.
		- Duy Raider (1.0⭐, 2025-01-31): The restaurant's service is so boring, I bought 1 glass and waited for nearly 20 minutes. Staff are joking
		- Nam DNS (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The drinks are ok, but Highland should consider the attitude and working style of the staff and management here. I had an extremely bad experience here. At first, I called the manager to ask if the parking lot was okay and if there were many people. After arriving at the parking lot, the car started to park and there was no sign of instructions on where to park the car. Once parked, the staff asked to move the car but did not come out to see or give instructions on where to park. At first, they told me to park the car at the gas station. Then they told me to park on the sidewalk, after parking, they were forced to move again, had to move to the other side of the street. Is it still fun to come in and drink a cup of coffee and then park and move the car for nearly 30 minutes until the ice melts?, meanwhile, the attitude of both the manager and parking lot staff is very mixed, like it's too crowded and doesn't care and wants to chase customers away. I told the staff to call the manager to discuss or ask about the rules and working style here. He said the manager was busy and couldn't come. This is a sincere suggestion. If the Hl Management Board reads it, please fix it
		- BẾU BẾU (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): The space is large, the water is like any other branch, there is a place to park motorbikes, cars are in front of the shop but right at the intersection so it's a bit sneaky.
		- Trần Đoàn Phong (4.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Cool and suitable to avoid heat, the water system is not good, mainly the seat :))
		- Toan Nhat Lam (5.0⭐, 2024-11-30): Having a spacious indoor 2-wheel parking space is a plus point of the shop!
		- Đức Nguyễn Hữu (Duck) (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Everything is ok, from the space to the drinks, but I hope to support payment by momo in the future because I often pay with this wallet.
		- Văn Tài Nguyễn (5.0⭐, 2021-03-31): Still love the taste of iced milk coffee at Highlands coffee. Bold flavor distinct from other coffee flavors. Impressive space layout
		- Minh Hiền Nguyễn (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The restaurant space is airy and clean. Beautifully decorated. The drinks here are very delicious. There is a large parking lot.
		- Vy Le (5.0⭐, 2021-03-31): Good service, friendly and cheerful staff. Reasonable price. The layout is also normal but okay. The shop also has a variety of drinks and pastries, but in my opinion, the lychee tea here is not as good as the one in Phuc Long (that's my own opinion), but in return, the coffee here is delicious and the bread from HIGHLANDS is no less. In my opinion, if you have HIGHLANDS again, don't miss the bread here. There is a place to park motorbikes and cars, I'm not sure.
		- Thanh Tung Vo (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Enthusiastic and attentive parking staff. Delicious drinks. The space is a bit noisy.
		- Thành Nguyễn (2.0⭐, 2024-03-31): On June 1st, I came to the shop. I come every week. That day, I saw the mini version at the cashier counter to pay for VN Pay with the promotion code VNPAYHL50 but I couldn't use it, and other customers saw that they couldn't use it either. The restaurant's side said it was to check again, then process it for the customer and send it back. But I sat there until I left and still didn't see anyone say anything and no explanation. I had to go directly and ask the staff again to get someone to answer a few questions.
		- Phương Tea (5.0⭐, 2024-12-31): I hope the shop plays the music playlist on weekdays, the Christmas music doesn't sound too chill huhu
		- Huy Lê (4.0⭐, 2021-03-31): Standard Highland taste Spacious space However, the toilet is small and there are always people.
		- Luân Nguyễn (4.0⭐, 2022-03-31): Delicious coffee, large space suitable for meeting work partners
		- Chu Nguyen The Hoang (5.0⭐, 2024-05-31): The restaurant is located in front of extended Nguyen Van Cu Street, Can Tho City. The shop space is reasonably arranged, spacious, airy, clean and has high brand recognition. There is a garage for motorbikes and parking for up to 4-5 cars which is quite good. The mixed drinks are delicious and delicious like most Highlands restaurants that I use. The dish I recommend to try is yellow lotus tea. There are cakes to eat. Enthusiastic staff, accurate dishes.
		- Kim Ngan (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Delicious drinks, spacious and beautiful space, enthusiastic service
		- Duy Doanh Dương (1.0⭐, 2024-11-30): The restaurant lacks many dishes compared to the menu
		- CỬA TIỆM MÀU XANH LÁ (5.0⭐, 2025-03-10): I really like this shop!
		- Nông Lê Duy (4.0⭐, 2024-09-30): The shop is suitable for groups of friends to talk or work
		- Tố Ngọc (5.0⭐, 2022-03-31): Delicious water, friendly and enthusiastic service staff
		- Sự Nhân (3.0⭐, 2023-03-31): The staff's attitude was polite and cute, but the bee suffocated in the glass of water before bringing the water out :<<<<<<
		- Anh Pham (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Hire employees who are dumb or something. Went in and waited 30 minutes, still no order. When asked about the manager with short hair, she got no answer. If she doesn't know how to speak, she should know how to write so people can know. Have 2-3 glasses of water and wait 30 minutes.
		- Thúy Hằng Hoa (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): I had a business trip to the province and saw the highland, thinking that the standard system coffee would be consistent, but the store manager's attitude was super bad (the employees are cute). When ordering in person, SM told me to add some milk, but when I brought it out, the cup was white and had a strong milky smell. When I brought it back to the complaint counter, they said "my coffee is here, if you want to drink a lot of coffee, order black coffee"?!??!??!? SM's customer service is extremely poor, even though it's your fault.
		- Ngọc Hân Hồ (5.0⭐, 2022-03-31): Delicious water, spacious and clean space. Highlands App is very convenient.
		- Tu Le (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): It took a long time for the restaurant to make the food, but no one gave instructions. Then I called out to the counter staff. The drink was empty, so I had to put it on before I had a tranning, so I had to check it again.
		- Vu Phung (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Drink coffee and eat bread, convenient, relatively space. Parking is about 200m from the restaurant, next to the hospital.
		- HUỲNH QUỐC TRẠNG (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): The cafe is very delicious Near Can Tho University of Medicine and Pharmacy. The toilet is clean, has a fragrant smell, the bathroom consists of 1 room divided into 2 rooms, one for men and one for women, and a shared sink. There is a security guard who guides the car very enthusiastically and covers the seat when it's sunny
		- Bảo Hoàng (5.0⭐, 2024-11-30): Enthusiastic and sophisticated staff
		- VanGiai Tran (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): The pastries at the restaurant are ok, the drinks are okay. The space of the restaurant is luxurious, clean and smooth. There is a parking space and a goat guard. Enthusiastic and attentive staff. I'm satisfied
		- JJ Yuen (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Good coffee, OK price, sit outside with dusty and dirty outdoor tables and chairs.
		- NV Phi (1.0⭐, 2023-03-31): The staff had an unpleasant attitude towards me. Stop by and buy 2 bags of coffee for 144k and I'll give you 500k. Showed immediate discomfort. When giving the items, leave 2 bags of coffee with the bag so I can put them in myself. The manager should review it, I don't normally buy it like that
		- DT (2.0⭐, 2023-03-31): I know that every time I come back, I use a voucher, which must make the staff very uncomfortable, but who is giving out vouchers? What's wrong with the employee's grandmother? If you go once, you'll get the yellow lotus tea but don't put in the cream, then next time. Also, because I didn't skip it last time, I warned you carefully, but it's even worse because there's no ice cream or milk. Talking about it, it's still ok, but when customers say it, please pay attention because there were no customers at that time and it's a bit far. but also struggled to run through Mau Than Before, he was very easy-going, but this time he was so angry
		- Thi Kim Thu Nguyen (Đông Ka) (3.0⭐, 2022-03-31): Now I use Freez green tea and yellow lotus tea. Freez's ice cream is very bland and the green tea flavor is not rich. And I also ordered a piece of cocoa cake, it was very bad to eat, the cake tasted very bitter, and was smooth when eaten.
		- Vân Anh Cao Thị (5.0⭐, 2022-03-31): The shop is large, the space is comfortable, the cakes and drinks are delicious, although the prices are a bit high, even when I sat down to the shop that was about to close, no one left a message, the shop is very cute and polite.
		- Minh Quách (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): You should review the way the PV NV counters the order in a curt manner until it's already late and then has the same attitude of whining about a series of coffees without training the NV before coming to work.
		- Việt Vinh Bùi (3.0⭐, 2023-03-31): As for the restaurant, it is very beautiful and the space at the branch is not too small. As for ordering, the staff is very professional and agile. As for making drinks, it takes an extremely long time and I am the one running the ship right at peak hours. I'm extremely fed up with the restaurant's orders because there are dishes that take too long to make. Many dishes take too long to make, but one day I received an order 10 minutes after arriving at the restaurant because the restaurant hadn't yet processed the combined order. I don't know if this is due to me. I'm new here so I don't know the shop's rules or what
		- phivan long (5.0⭐, 2022-03-31): Comfortable space to sit with friends 😁 …
		- Thanh Lê Nguyễn Huỳnh (4.0⭐, 2022-03-31): The reputation matches the reality but the preparation of the dish takes a bit of time
		- Thao Mach (5.0⭐, 2021-03-31): Delicious water, enthusiastic staff, clean toilets. The restaurant space is quite airy. It's a place where my friends and I often go to drink and chat
		- Triều Lê Nhật (2.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The water came out very slowly, the table was dirty and no one cleaned it. There are few staff cars so customers can park wherever they want
		- Thanh Khánh Nguyễn (5.0⭐, 2024-07-31): Delicious coffee, good coffee experience space - clean
		- Gia Việt Trương (1.0⭐, 2022-03-31): On March 16, 2022, around 7-8 p.m., I parked my car in front of Highland on Nguyen Van Cu street, Can Tho. I didn't know how to protect it. My car fell down and some parts on the car were damaged. I hope the security guards at this branch work more properly and harder :).
		- huy quách nam (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Bought a cup of milk coffee and waited 20 minutes. The restaurant is not crowded but the service is so poor
		- Thúy Quỳnh (4.0⭐, 2023-03-31): The bathroom is small, men and women are in the same area divided into 2 rooms, sharing a mirror and sink so it's a bit inconvenient. I thought I entered the wrong men's toilet
		- Thiên Thanh (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Spacious and cool space.
		- Gau99 Live In CanTho City (5.0⭐, 2022-03-31): 5 Stars ! This place is beautiful near Can Tho University of Medicine and Pharmacy. Location: frontage of Nguyen Van Cu No Dai Street.

Outdoor smoking area.  - Service: cheerful and enthusiastic staff. - Payment: VISA card, Mastercard. Momo.
		- Tien Nguyen (2.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Water is ok, but around 9:50 a.m. I buy water again but the staff has an attitude when applying the voucher
		- Huong Nguyen (1.0⭐, 2023-03-31): The store was out of items but it didn't update on the app, so the shipper came to inform them that the items were out of stock. IT'S A LOT OF TIME.
		- nghia le van (5.0⭐, 2025-03-03): Okay
		- Socute Huỳnh Nhi (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Delicious, affordable
		- Quynh Ta (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Near Can Tho University of Medicine and Pharmacy. The shop is quite noisy compared to shops in Phuc Long or The Coffee House. The toilet is clean, has a fragrant smell, the bathroom consists of 1 room divided into 2 rooms, one for men and one for women, and a shared sink. There is a security guard who guides the car very enthusiastically and covers the seat when it's sunny.
		- Văn Thân (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Great space, avoid hot coffee. The air conditioning here is very strong.
		- Bod Johnny (3.0⭐, 2022-03-31): The shop is small, most people take away. The drinks are okay, nothing special

reviews:
		- JJ JJ (4.0⭐, 2018-03-31): Very spacious location with cool AC and fans if you need them. They also accept credit cards too!
		- Khang Le (1.0⭐, 2023-03-31): 55k
		- La Eric (2.0⭐, 2024-04-30): The shop is too hot, the price of a cup of peach jelly tea 65k is high compared to the average but the service is too bad. The old glass of water on the table had no staff to clean it up, even if there was no air conditioning, I wouldn't stop by again!
		- Ngọc Tuyền Nguyễn (2.0⭐, 2025-03-31): Twice the experience was not good. The water and space were very good, but the staff's attitude was not very friendly and cheerful. They answered blankly and were not enthusiastic about supporting. I went to other branches and the staff were very good. Every time I went to the supermarket, I was so tired that I stopped by for a drink. Twice the staff were not very welcoming, huhu.
		- Quỳnh Anh Trần Nguyễn (2.0⭐, 2025-03-31): Staff has attitude, empty speech, no respect for customers, no fun. Bad attitude, I hope the company sees it and fixes it
		- Mint (2.0⭐, 2025-03-31): Minus points for staff. Talking blankly, not knowing who he was talking to. "What to drink?", "What size?", "Take this and wait." The reason if given is usually: crowded, tired staff, busy. At that time, there were not many customers and not a few staff, about 5-6 people; The staff is not tired, standing around in the counter, not cleaning or serving, this is coffee, not food. Clear disdain for people. No return.
		- Cherry Lee (3.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Came here quite a few times. The quality of service at Tani Highlands is without question. My first time drinking lychee tea, it was quite delicious. The parking lot is spacious, the space is large, but the number of customers is so large that it is sometimes a bit stuffy.
		- Vinh Truong (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Location right at the entrance of Lotte Mart - Mau Than, around the shops there is music playing so it is noisy (not suitable for people who like quiet).
		- Tran John (3.0⭐, 2024-11-30): Food and drinks ok. The thing is, coffee ran out at 8:30 p.m., which is a shame.
		- Trịnh Khanh (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The space is quite airy, but the chairs are a bit dirty, the staff is not very welcoming, the water taste is the same in every system.
		- Quỳnh (2.0⭐, 2025-03-31): Staff attitude It's too hot at noon. Is the staff hot?
		- Minh Huy Phan (1.0⭐, 2025-03-03): Sales staff are rude and unprofessional
		- POTATO Garden (5.0⭐, 2018-03-31): Highlands is famous for delicious milk coffee. The price is high but if you think it's a drink to enjoy, it's worth it. Airy, luxurious space suitable for business people or office workers to receive guests and discuss CVs. Wifi is quite good.
		- Minh Trang ^^ (1.0⭐, 2022-03-31): I ordered through the shopee food app but the store made many errors: - peach jelly tea delivery was missing peaches and jelly - Individually kicked notes can still be played together - This time I ordered 2 cups of the medium size and delivered the small size while just yesterday I ordered a different size and still kept the compared cup. - Called for feedback but didn't answer the phone So this time I rate 1 star
		- Hp. Dose (Capan) (3.0⭐, 2020-03-31): Delicious coffee, stable, reasonable price, a bit expensive compared to students and regular offices. There is a problem that needs to be urgently fixed: the electrical outlet system serving customer needs needs to be upgraded, because most of the outlets are loose or unevenly distributed.
		- Trần Tinh (5.0⭐, 2020-03-31): Delicious coffee, very good working space. Suitable for people who often use computers for work like me.
		- Venus Kim (5.0⭐, 2024-07-31): The shop is clean, the service is good, the staff are lovely, I forgot something and they kept it for me, the shop is inside a supermarket so it's a bit noisy.
		- Khánh Trương (4.0⭐, 2018-03-31): Also delicious! But the quality of cake preservation is not good. The price is also a bit "expensive" for students and students
		- Phúc Hạnh (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Calling it yellow lotus tea, I thought it was coffee. The color of the tea was black, not at all like other highlands Too much, too grumpy, looking for iced tea, I was introduced to mineral water for 15k/bottle kk
		- Uy Nguyễn Ngọc Phát (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Water delivery is not according to customer needs, when there is feedback that does not meet customer needs, it is not worth visiting
		- Nga Nguyen (5.0⭐, 2019-03-31): Delicious drinks...beautiful space...
		- Dương Nguyễn (5.0⭐, 2021-03-31): Quite good, there is outdoor seating, a table enough for 2 people, and chairs with cushions that are quite comfortable. Airy space... Overall, it's worth 5*, not to mention the service staff is quite friendly.
		- ĐĂNG NGHIÊM TRẦN (TOMMYNGHIÊM) (3.0⭐, 2020-03-31): Ok, all you have to do is not introduce promotions or pre-emptive promotions to customers when ordering. Ordered 1 cup of milk coffee, finished drinking and bought 1 more cup to take home, only to notice that on the receipt it said buy 2 cups and get a 20% discount.
		- Tan Vo Phu (4.0⭐, 2020-03-31): The view is very beautiful, the morning is very cool, the coffee is delicious
		- Pp (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Delicious water, dedicated staff, minus point: it's very dark inside and a bit noisy outside

		- Đình Ấn (1.0⭐, 2018-03-31): Waited more than 1 hour to get water.
		- Khang Lê (1.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Cappuccino is nothing more than a slightly bitter filtered water, only 55k
		- Nhật Thanh Trương Trần (5.0⭐, 2020-03-31): Great coffee
		- Trung Nguyễn (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): It takes a long time to make things, it takes nearly an hour to finish
		- Quỳnh Hân Phạm Nguyễn (2.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Staff's attitude towards customers when buying small sizes
		- Hải Năng Ngọc (3.0⭐, 2019-03-31): Not suitable for coffee, drinking fatty milk tea is boring
		- Sales TV THANG (5.0⭐, 2020-03-31): Great with a cup of Iced Milk Coffee

reviews:
		- Fabio Biocchetti (2.0⭐, 2024-11-30): Staff is a bit rude and they don’t speak a single word of English. In terms of drinks and food, it’s just an average Highland Coffee.
		- Michael Leander (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The one server who spoke English was an added bonus.  Chocolate cake decent, cappucino really not great.  Location next to city sense mall is convenient
		- Wietse Theeuwen (4.0⭐, 2020-03-31): Good coffee and location in Can Tho. Food is delicious and very reasonably priced. Ambience good be a lot better if they would separate the cafe from the mall. Other than that, the WiFi is good and it’s still a good place to relax for a bit.
		- JJ JJ (3.0⭐, 2018-03-31): Good coffee with corner city outdoor views. They have no fans inside and do not accept credit cards. What a pain in the ***!
		- D O (3.0⭐, 2019-03-31): Upscale coffee place, on the pricey side. Courteous staff, decent coffee (especially ca phe phin), a few good desserts (cheesecake, mousse, etc). AC permanently set to "ice age".
		- Michael S (4.0⭐, 2021-03-31): A bit crammed in the corner of co-op department store, but otherwise like all other Highland cafes : good western style Americano, Cappuccino etc, the baguettes are great.
		- Vinh Tran (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): I think this is the best coffee chain in Vietnam. So consistent. They use the phin for all their drip coffee and it’s so strong and potent.  My go to for cafe den or cafe Sua da in Vietnam.
		- X Tedder (3.0⭐, 2020-03-31): Limited seating, aircon hot, food still ok
		- Khai Do (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): A cup of traditional coffee gives you much more energy. With some cakes, bread indoors with air-conditioning, and outdoors for those who enjoy some fresh air.
		- Adelyn Leong (4.0⭐, 2020-03-31): Coffee were so yummuy. Best in town.😋 …
		- Tuan Dang (4.0⭐, 2018-03-31): Ok.

		- Đức Nguyễn Văn (4.0⭐, 2020-03-31): ok
		- Thảo Như Nguyễn (1.0⭐, 2025-03-31): On the evening of February 20, 2025, at 9:50 am, I went in and asked if it was still for sale. The staff hesitated, then looked at the manager before accepting the sale, but the staff's attitude was very strange, clearly because the counter had been cleaned. Even the manager has this attitude towards me! If you don't want to sell, then say no and I'm ready to leave. If you want to sell, then be friendly, but why do you have that kind of attitude of glancing at others? Big chain stores need to fix this part
		- Mai Trúc Nguyễn (5.0⭐, 2024-12-31): The outside space is quite large but a bit hot. Inside, there are 2 rows of sofas. Enthusiastic staff.
		- tiên phan (1.0⭐, 2024-12-31): I order combo. After the interviewer asked, he ordered the bill for a glass of water and did not order the combo for me. He also said he had to buy the cake separately. The type of unprofessional staff who doesn't ask customers carefully causes dissatisfaction
		- Camera Men (5.0⭐, 2024-07-31): The service is good, the drinks are delicious, but I have a few questions that I would like to comment on: have the order staff been trained to ask if customers want to go up a size or is that your normal way of inviting guests?  Just now I was a bit impatient because the employee asked me 3 times if I wanted to upgrade from size M to L? I answered M twice but you kept asking mechanically!  And I want to apologize because my family is busy so I'm a bit busy when receiving water, but you guys still serve me well!
		- MINH TUAN TRUONG (1.0⭐, 2025-01-31): This year, Highland is doing a New Year lucky money program, like cheating on black cards.... it's better not to do it and people will still support it. If you do it like you don't want to give it to customers, then don't do it. I think it's too bad and do it. customer harm.... for customers to scan the QR code after receiving the promotion voucher, it will take effect 1 hour later, especially not applicable on holidays, new year, and after new year it can be used.. .. so what kind of lucky money is given to customers? 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
		- Hưng Nguyễn Quốc (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Customers drink coffee every day. But the waiter told the supermarket's cleaning staff that this family came to the restaurant with a bunch of junk food. Then that cleaning staff turned out to be a maid for my Parents' house. I told my parents that we went to a local coffee shop and the staff at Highlands cafe said that
		- Anh Đại Huỳnh Nguyễn (5.0⭐, 2024-08-31): The cashier on the afternoon of August 23 was very cute. enthusiastic, forgot to ask your name. Will stop by to support you
		- Cherry Lee (3.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Highlands has a very small space, sometimes when you meet friends and there is no room, you have to cancel and go to another Highlands, incurring additional parking fees. You have to come early or go alone. If you go with 3 people, it's hard to find a table. S Matcha Freeze is always so delicious. Sometimes when I crave it, I need a large glass to satisfy it.
		- Phương Thy (1.0⭐, 2025-01-31): Cooking takes a long time. Male staff wears glasses and has an attitude towards customers
		- Thanh Việt (4.0⭐, 2020-03-31): Nice location, with parking. Drinks are not good compared to other places. The view is quite crowded and bustling because it is next to the shopping center.
		- Men Nguyen (3.0⭐, 2024-09-30): The staff does not ask the customer what size to drink, but defaults to the bill size L, which the customer requests to exchange. Drinking water as well as other branches. The space is small and the most boring, not even having a separate toilet. If you drink early and the shopping center isn't open yet, where will the customers go???
		- Trần Đoàn Phong (3.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Not a great machine, the view is okay, the drinks are normal
		- Ha Binh Land (4.0⭐, 2025-03-31): Nice shop Central location Buy a large cup and get a small one for free
		- Duong Khanh (5.0⭐, 2021-03-31): Central location, beautiful view, parking for cars and motorbikes. In front of the 2 facades, go to the cafe in November, choose a location along the sidewalk with cool breeze blowing, very cool 😀. Highland Coffee standard drinks👍 …
		- Agnes J (5.0⭐, 2020-03-31): I quickly stopped by the shop, ordered a few familiar dishes like frozen green tea, lychee tea, lotus tea, coffee... a few loaves of bread, 1 green tea cake and 1 cocoa mousse cake. The shop is still crowded as usual, like any other highland store. But I really like the staff here, their service attitude is dedicated and very cute!
		- Kim Ngan (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Lychee jelly tea here is very delicious, the shop has a very beautiful and airy view outside
		- Bảo Trân Thạch Huỳnh (4.0⭐, 2020-03-31): I have to say, I'm extremely addicted to the frozen green tea here. Although Highlands is famous for its coffee, I haven't had a chance to try it because I always drink frozen. In addition, peach tea or peach jelly tea are worth trying. The staff is friendly, and one thing I really like is ordering customers in order. Whoever comes first gets to order first, it's not like those who come later get to order first and those who come first have to wait.
		- Va Le (1.0⭐, 2024-07-31): If you buy a medium size drink, ask for another 10k, I'll drink the large size, I don't agree, it makes me feel bad, if I buy bread for him, I let him eat it inside, but if I buy bread outside, I don't let him eat it, I feel like he's drinking cf. Here according to its principles, dm highlands needs peace avenue poetry
		- Captain America (4.0⭐, 2019-03-31): Although a bit small, it is quite beautiful and luxurious, located in a good location. Staff is ok, quality is the same as other Highlands.
		- Mập Con (1.0⭐, 2024-09-30): Even after ordering a lot of money, the driver wouldn't let the driver transfer the money, forcing the driver to withdraw some money to get a bill, which is too bad
		- Khoa Phì Lủ (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Although the coffee quality is not as good as Trung Nguyen coffee, the price is more affordable. Especially without having to wait long.
		- Kiet Michelin (5.0⭐, 2020-03-31): The quality of coffee and service are the same as many other systems of Highlands Coffee, but here the location is good, the space is small but cozy and cool, the parking lot is within the supermarket so it is spacious and convenient.
		- Thanh Khánh Nguyễn (5.0⭐, 2024-07-31): Recognize 5 stars for the restaurant Good coffee Staff and store managers are enthusiastic, cheerful, and provide professional service Drink regularly and support Highland at this location!
		- Phương Cao (3.0⭐, 2018-03-31): The drinks are delicious, but some dishes that are quite sweet should be adjusted
		- Thủy Tiên Trần (5.0⭐, 2024-12-31): The weather is cold near Christmas and the atmosphere is really nice
		- quang vinh pham (5.0⭐, 2019-03-31): In my opinion, the drinks and cakes are delicious, but the grilled meat sandwiches are not to my taste. The space is beautiful and the staff is enthusiastic and cute.
		- Minh Hiền Nguyễn (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): New dish Peach mango snow tea has a new and delicious taste. Worth enjoying.
		- Xuân Nhàn Nguyễn Thị (3.0⭐, 2024-04-30): On Monday evening, April 15, 2024, I stopped by and ordered water at the counter but the staff talked rudely but didn't want to answer After the customer ordered and paid, the staff didn't speak clearly. I asked again 3 times, but the attitude was loud and said that there was no subject. despise guests I asked about a bank transfer because I didn't bring cash, but the staff had an unpleasant attitude and yelled at me. It's special. Higland sencity now doesn't accept bank transfers. I don't know if I accept it or not, but the way you talk is very unreasonable Can anyone tell me if they don't accept money transfers or what?
		- Thanh B Nguyen (4.0⭐, 2024-06-30): Everyone knows the Highland system, this shop's location is right in the crowded center, convenient for coffee with friends, shopping, and walking around the streets!!
		- Thành Nguyễn (5.0⭐, 2020-03-31): Delicious water, clean space Service is attentive, shop management is very professional
		- Duc Duy Pham (4.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Delicious, bold, strong coffee! Comfortable space to relax and work
		- Tran Huu Tien (1.0⭐, 2020-03-31): Caffe is good, but young people hate this place
		- An Nguyen Hoang (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Delicious drinks, with good accompanying promotions
		- Play TAB (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Delicious green tea
		- Hội Quỳnh (4.0⭐, 2020-03-31): According to Google's instructions, the map is out of place and I have corrected it, waiting for review.
		- Chu Hiếu (5.0⭐, 2025-01-31): Highland quality is the same at all shops
		- F1s Oppo (4.0⭐, 2021-03-31): Professional, clean, polite
		- THIÊN TƯỜNG TRẦN (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The restaurant is located in the Sense city Can Tho campus so it is quite crowded, especially in the evening. Drinks still follow Highlands' signature style, with indoor air-conditioned areas and outdoor seating.
		- Nguyễn Ngọc Trúc Vy 22-08-96 (1.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Highlands everywhere has online transfer payments, but not here!  The staff said they only accept cash or swiping cards. I told them I didn't need to bring cash so the cashier turned around and asked one of the staff to come out and give me the check. She gave me the cash back but her attitude was not happy.  A moment later, my friend came and ran back to tell me that he didn't have any cash and thought he could pay online. I just stood up to ask, but the cashier glanced at me and told my friend that the other employee had gone home and couldn't transfer the money! After that, I ignored my friend and didn't support me at all and didn't want to sell my water either :))  We also have money to transfer money when we call, not beggars! While other places always leave QR codes to scan to limit contact, here they probably only sell to customers who have cash and dress beautifully and luxuriously!
		- Thúy Huỳnh Lưu (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): The space is a bit narrow, the restaurant is self-service
		- Gau99 Live In CanTho City (5.0⭐, 2024-06-30): 5 stars!!! Great !!! Strong Free Wifi! Air-conditioner ! The water tastes delicious. I have to do a long review about H.C this place: Highlands Coffee Sense City is H.C's first facility when returning to Can Tho. Maybe before 2014 - 2015. Location: located in Sense City shopping mall, with Coopmark supermarket, CGV movie theater,... on the 2nd floor are clothes shops, restaurants... a lot of expensive things. Space: there are 2 areas The indoor air-conditioned area has about 10 tables The outside area, where smoking is allowed, is also a bit sunny, but when it rains it gets splashed with water Drink quality: delicious. Exactly like other H.C stores in the same system. So there's nothing to discuss. The staff is cheerful and enthusiastic. Payment: MoMo, Bank card, Napas, VISA, MasterCard, cash. Order: first come, first served, queue. Paying in advance at the counter makes many people in Can Tho confused (because the restaurant usually serves first and pays later).
		- Diem hong (4.0⭐, 2023-03-31): The restaurant is located in an expensive location, but the price is listed so the quality and price are good, the service staff is good, but the restaurant's seats are quite small. I have visited many times without a seat.
		- Zai Tri (3.0⭐, 2021-03-31): Also crowded, with outdoor view
		- Phong Le Loi (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): The restaurant serves very professionally and is crowded with customers. There is outdoor space and air conditioning. Convenient shopping at the supermarket.
		- Victor Nguyễn (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): The restaurant serves drinks quite quickly. Enthusiastic staff advises customers on promotions!
		- Giang Binh (1.0⭐, 2021-03-31): I always drink peach jelly tea and say not to put milk cream on top, because the peach jelly tea and the tea below and the milk cream on top can normally be separated, but today I came at 12 o'clock to order peach jelly tea. milk cream, but the staff said peach jelly tea has milk inside and brought me a glass full of milk. When I went to the counter to order, they still said peach jelly tea had milk inside.  I want to ask if Highland changed the recipe or did the branch intentionally mix all the milk into the tea?
		- Dulcie Tran (1.0⭐, 2020-03-31): Worst of all the other branches I've ever used. It's probably a franchise but it seems like they saved too much on ingredients. I've only tried the yellow lotus tea and will never come back again. The tea is too bitter and the lotus is too hard. In general, there is nothing similar to the traditional taste that I used to drink.
		- QUOC VAN NGUYEN (5.0⭐, 2020-03-31): Fast service, clean...
		- Hoàng Vỹ (5.0⭐, 2020-03-31): The quality of coffee and cakes is very good!

		- Nguyen Hong Phat (3.0⭐, 2020-03-31): The coffee is delicious, but unfortunately the establishment is too economical to use plastic cups and does not have tea to drink with it, the price is not reasonable!!!
		- Song Thuận (4.0⭐, 2020-03-31): The space is not as spacious as other branches, most tables are almost full, sometimes 2 people have to sit at 2 different tables, the best option is to buy it to take home or go somewhere else to drink.. The drinks are still of good quality, especially the coffee flavor here is unmistakable..you have to drink it at max size..addictive...🤣🤣🤣

		- Ngọc Trâm A9 (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): I often drink Highlands at Vincom Hung Vuong, I drink it on the spot, I also buy it to take away, and every time I'm satisfied with the quality and service of the Highlands staff. You guys are always very enthusiastic, many times I call ahead to warn you, but when I'm done calling to ask if you're done, they bring the car to me (so I don't have to worry about sending the car😍😍) The drinks are well-mixed, delicious, and very suitable for my taste. I can drink Highlands all the time and I won't get tired of it
		- Alex Dương (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Located in Vincom Hung Vuong, view right around the corner! Coffee is just like any other Highlands shop!
		- Nguyễn Sơn (2.0⭐, 2023-03-31): The space is not too large but the decor is reasonably neat Polite and courteous staff The drinks are just like other branches but nothing else Because it is an open space in Vincom, it is a bit noisy
		- BẾU BẾU (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): Located in Vincom, you will have to park your car in the basement and then go up. Like many other branches, the staff is quick to order, the water is also quick, and the service is attentive and attentive. The day I went to buy 1 get 1 free, but I was alone, the staff suggested that I leave a glass as a gift to prepare for work, but with a very cute attitude, then 10/10 😉
		- 20 Hùng Vương Cơ Sở VỎ XE A LẬP (5.0⭐, 2025-03-31): The new dish coconut phindi is very good

The cream puff served with it is a bit cold, and the filling is quite fragrant. The open space is quite spacious and comfortable. View overlooking the bustling Hung Vuong roundabout. Located on the ground floor of Vincom Hung Vuong so it is quite cool, in return it will be noisy, not suitable for those who like quiet.

		- Hoà Thái Nguyễn (2.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The staff was impolite. I stopped by the restaurant to sit for a bit during the hot lunch. I told the staff to ask for a fan because it was hot. The staff turned on the fan. After I sat for a bit, the staff was afraid of wasting electricity so I turned it off and said bye. never visit a second time 🤒
		- TRẦN THANH ĐỒNG (5.0⭐, 2024-08-31): Good drinks. But the price is high. The place is not large either. Spitting table
		- Vo Dang (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Diverse dishes. Enthusiastic staff. Serve drinks quickly. Beautiful view right on the ground floor. Park your car in a convenient basement. However, the NVS on the 2nd floor is a bit inconvenient
		- Đăng khoa Nguyễn (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The manager here should reconsider that a male employee with a big tattoo on his chest is taking doilies to deliver customers, he's not a beggar but his face looks so hateful and his attitude is too much.
		- Luân Nguyễn Hoàng (5.0⭐, 2024-07-31): Friendly and cheerful staff, normal drinks
		- Lu Key 112 (4.0⭐, 2024-06-30): In general, Highlands is a great brand... Good with everything but just have to wait a bit
		- Diem hong (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): The shop is located in a cool supermarket. Order drinks quickly. Drinks and cakes come in many sizes: small, medium, large, depending on the listed price, so there is no need to judge the price and quality of the drinks here.
		- Khoa Nguyễn (5.0⭐, 2023-03-31): No matter where you go, you still stop by Highland Land when you have the opportunity to gather friends. Highland has very convenient visa and master payments. I like Green Tea Freeze the most

		- Dennis William (1.0⭐, 2022-03-31): At 8:40 p.m. the shop ran out of coffee, asked for another dish... it was all gone, "I only have 2 crushed ice dishes left" why is such a big shop like this out of popular drinks at this hour? Or do you not want to receive guests anymore?
		- Kingfisher Duong (4.0⭐, 2024-03-31): It's a bit hot to go at noon. Because the space is open, those who can't tolerate the heat should go to branches with closed spaces

		- Ngọc Điều Lê (Hùng) (5.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Coffe highland
		- Trung Hoàng (5.0⭐, 2024-12-31): The restaurant is located in an easy-to-find location in Can Tho, with a spacious and convenient parking area. The restaurant space has a pretty good view, suitable for sitting and chatting with friends. Drinks still maintain the typical quality like other Highlands Coffee branches.
		- Tuan Nguyen (5.0⭐, 2024-12-31): The restaurant is spacious and the staff is cheerful and enthusiastic. I stopped by on a business trip and found it very good. Will still stop by to support if I have the opportunity to work in Can Tho
		- Trân Trân (5.0⭐, 2025-03-17): Today I went to coffee at the highlands Tran Van Nghe with an enthusiastic consulting sales staff (Minh Quan), quick water making, comfortable space. I am very satisfied
		- Sơn Trang Trần (5.0⭐, 2025-03-10): Just stopped by this morning to buy a cup of morning coffee. But thanks to the cheerful and enthusiastic way of working and the friendly smiles of the staff, I am energized for the whole day 😍
		- Harley Nguyễn (1.0⭐, 2025-03-31): My personality has been quite easy before, but today I experienced quite bad service with Highlands Tran Van Nghe. I didn't have any difficulty waiting, but the manager took care of scanning the voucher code for the other customer and couldn't scan it, so I waited for quite a while before being able to order by someone else.  I finished ordering, got the bill, then continued to scan the voucher and didn't give me change until the bartender brought my order and I went home and still hadn't scanned it. Hope Highlands improves service.
		- Chiến Dũng Ngô (1.0⭐, 2024-03-31): Arrived at the restaurant at 8:15 a.m., the tables and chairs were still collected a pile, the security guard did not see any parking space, the outside area was not yet set up with tables and chairs. I don't understand how Highlands does business, it doesn't respect customers at all. I'm a regular customer at the tvk branch but I'm very disappointed. I won't come back again. It looks like an abandoned shop.
		- Nguyen Han (1.0⭐, 2024-06-30): I am a tourist to Tay Do, I am quite impressed with this place. It was raining so it was convenient to turn to HL Tran Van Kheo to buy a cup of coffee. I saw there were cups and a vase so while standing in line and looking at the vase to see and buy, the employee at the counter wearing a "store manager" tag called me to order the goods. drank with a very dissatisfied attitude. I'm also in line to buy coffee pots and cups, so I don't understand the employee's attitude 🙂
		- Thái Hưng Nguyễn (5.0⭐, 2024-07-31): Can Tho city center, right on the corner, lots of parking, spacious restaurant, delicious drinks, beautiful restaurant, outdoor area and cold room, near Can Tho exhibition center, busiest road need poetry. Surrounded by many eateries and hotels, it is very convenient

		- Hai Nguyen (5.0⭐, 2025-03-10): Minz Sweet Girl staff hasn't seen me in a while. She misses me
		- Cao Hoàng Tâm (1.0⭐, 2024-11-30): November 24th was a really bad experience for me, specifically the security named vic had an extreme attitude towards customers. I had only been here for a long time before he cleverly chased me away even though I had spent money. including my trust to order a glass of water just to sit for a while asking the manager to deal with his unprofessional attitude.
		- Vo Lan Vy Du (5.0⭐, 2024-12-31): The space is great, the drinks are delicious and the staff is friendly.

		- Thọ Phạm (2.0⭐, 2024-03-31): The drinks were delicious, but the children were playing too much, causing trouble for others, running into me 5 or 6 times, pulling the table, shouting, and being noisy. Managers should remind the parents of those children that if they want to keep that one customer, they should trade it with all the other customers. We won't come here again.
