There's a customer we're trying to see if we can get a salary for you, but your attitude and response are like wanting to leave humiliated. Truly memorable experience.

		- Tuy·ªÅn Hu·ª≥nh (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-04-28): The movie was shown at 9:20 a.m. but tickets were not yet sold at 9:15 a.m., the projector was not yet open, and the staff was ignorant. The manager was also very polite, clearly I arrived early and waited, but when I bought a ticket, he forced me in right away and told me I was late.
		- H·∫£i Nguy·ªÖn (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-04-28): Today. I went to Vincom Hung Vuong Can Tho to watch the movie Kong Godzilla at 7:00 p.m. The employee sold 3 tickets. Then asked if I could use corn with water. I replied "a big country with big corn". The staff said that with this combo, the water will be in a plastic cup, 1 coke will be given, and then charged 463,000 VND. At this point, I found the price to be expensive, but I still paid because I don't watch movies often. When I received the popcorn, I realized it was a Godzilla plastic cup. After watching the movie, when I got home and checked the ticket price at this time frame the next day, 3 tickets, 1 large drink, 1 large corn were only 311,000 VND. Thus, the employee arbitrarily sold the wrong customer's request, bypassed the customer, and gave dishonest advice to sell popcorn and drink combos (plastic cups). While I only asked for big corn and big water, I didn't need to buy any plastic cups.

		- B√°nh M√¨ (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): In the 4.0 era, it is also known as a large theater complex, but customers who book tickets through the app are still forced to go back to the counter to get printed tickets, while many other theaters just book tickets online and receive a code to check at the theater without needing to return. Queuing counter to get tickets, harsh criticism
		- Th√°i H∆∞ng Nguy·ªÖn (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Commercial center, fully equipped with restaurants, Phuc Long cafe, highland, clothes, shoes, supermarket, introduction point for Vinfast vehicles, children's play center, video games, cinema movies, basement has parking, electric car charging, family can travel comfortably and coolly.
		- Thanh V√µ (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-05-28): The consulting staff is very bad.

There was a female employee who spoke in a very rude and angry attitude towards customers and all other customers also had the same attitude. I also gave feedback directly to the manager there.
		- Di·ªán V√¥ (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-04-28): The theater's service is very bad, they don't know how to solve problems, the staff has a bad attitude, and the management is very unprofessional.
		- Thanh Ki·ªÅu ƒê·∫∑ng (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Probably due to taste, I feel that Phuc Long here is better than other places. The lounge chair is quite torn. The restaurant should take more care. Staff and service are quite good.

		- Minh Tr·∫ßn (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Problem with parking fee: if you buy goods with an invoice but forget to get a parking ticket, the fee will still be charged. But when going shopping, no one remembers the parking service. It's a small matter but feels dissatisfied with this regulation. Will not shop here again. Not as good as Sense City, just need a receipt of purchase to send the car for free.
		- Th·∫ø L·∫≠p (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Very happy
		- L·ªôc Tr·∫ßn (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Very comfortable and spacious experience

		- H·ªì Minh Tri·∫øt (1.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): The security guards had a very bad attitude, so I saw most of them parking around and not going into the basement, now I know. I hope Vincom will correct it or else we will lose all customers

		- Quang Tr·ª±c ƒê·ªó (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Beautiful scenery, food service, parking, clean. However, you should visit early in the morning or late in the afternoon because there is no shade of trees here

		- The Dung Nguyen (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): The supermarket is clean, the parking lot is airy and safe. But seeing that the items being sold are probably for the well-off and above. The goods are not diverse and the prices are a bit high.
		- Khoa Nguy·ªÖn (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): The supermarket is very large and modern. The slope down to the parking lot is not very high so it is easy to run. The shopping areas on the upper floors are quite small. Mainly eating and watching movies.

		- V√¢n Ph·∫°m (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): One of two Vincom commercial towers in Can Tho. Very full of culinary services, movie entertainment, gaming areas, and shops from medium to high-end. But perhaps the number of visitors is uneven, so the guards are a bit indifferent and superficial in guiding visitors to visit and use the service.
		- THI√äN T∆Ø·ªúNG TR·∫¶N (4.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): Vincom Hung Vuong Can Tho commercial center is located at the intersection of Hung Vuong - Tran Phu - CMT8 - Nguyen Trai, Can Tho, this location used to be Maximark Hung Vuong Supermarket.

		- Tung SH (4.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): I only rate Phuc Long alone, it's very bad. The staff said to the customer rudely: the customer was waiting for a coffee on a very wide street, but the female staff looked at the customer and said curtly 'give it away', don't let me stop by.
		- Th√°i B·∫ßu (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): I've stopped by to buy a Vinfast car, and had a bad impression because if you come to Vincom too early, no one will greet you. Because the staff there (I don't know where else) don't show up to work until 9 o'clock. (A job that's really worth looking forward toüòÜüòÜ) ‚Ä¶
		- Minh BT (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Prime location, diverse services. A small minus point is the lack of quick parking for customers to pick up items immediately.
		- Kien Huynh Trung (2.0‚≠ê, 2024-04-28): Not convenient, lack of parking. Service quality has decreased, restaurants need to censor quality. Few shops!
		- Thang Bao (1.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): Car parking is often full, or reserved for Vinfast. So are the stores throughout the Vincom building only for Vinfast customers? The businesses in this building lost quite a bit of revenue.
		- Ly Nguy·ªÖn V√µ Kh√°nh (5.0‚≠ê, 2024-03-28): The supermarket is big and has many genuine goods and malls, located right in the center so it is very convenient to get here

		- Freda Happiess (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): I visited Can Tho and went to Vincom to drink highland. It seemed like it had not been built long ago because it seemed quite new. The interesting thing is that you can go to the 1st floor to go to the toilet, but there is none on the ground floorüòÑ. But in return, the ground floor also has Vinfast cars displayed in the lobby, looking gorgeous. If I have a chance, I will definitely stop by for a walk once in a while to visit.

		- Huy L√™ (5.0‚≠ê, 2025-03-28): - When you are old enough, you will see that an adult is a great person. They can do well at work, part-time jobs or side jobs, family work, relatives' work, and friends' work. In general, they fulfill all their default duties and they become a shining example to those who cannot fulfill them as well. But behind that is fatigue, boredom, and sometimes just thinking about it makes them sick, but they still have to do it. Why? Because they are adults, in addition to living for themselves, they also have to live for their family, their relatives, their in-laws and have to maintain relationships with friends of all kinds... In general, when you are old enough you will understand.
